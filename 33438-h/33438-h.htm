<h1>SEA HOUNDS</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE MEN WHO CHANGED SHIPS</h3>


<p>Between the lighter-load of burning beeves
that came bumping down along their line at
noon, a salvo of bombs slapped across
them at one o&rsquo;clock from a raiding Bulgar air
squadron, a violent Levantine squall which all but
broke them loose from their moorings at sundown,
and a signal to raise steam for full speed with all
dispatch at midnight, it had been a rather exciting
twelve hours for the destroyers of the First Division
of the &mdash;&mdash;th Flotilla, and now, when at dawn
the expected order to proceed to sea was received,
it began to look as though there might be still further
excitement in pickle down beyond the horizontal
blur where the receding wall of the paling
purple night-mist was uncovering the Gulf&rsquo;s hard,
flat floor of polished indigo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the same old thing,&rdquo; said the captain
of the <i>Spark</i>, repressing a yawn after he had
given the quartermaster his course to enter the
labyrinthine passage where puffing trawlers were
towing back the gates of the buoyed barrages, &ldquo;a<!-- Page 2 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
U-boat or two making a bluff at attacking a convoy.
They&rsquo;ve been sinking a good deal more than we can
afford to lose; last week they got an oiler and
another ship with the whole summer&rsquo;s supply of
mosquito-netting aboard&mdash;but that was off the south
peninsula of Greece or up Malta way. Here they
haven&rsquo;t more than &lsquo;demonstrated&rsquo; about the mouth
of the Gulf for two or three months. They know
jolly well that if they once come inside, no matter
if they do sink a ship or two, that it&rsquo;s a hundred
to one&mdash;between sea-planes, &lsquo;blimps,&rsquo; P.B.s, and
destroyers&mdash;against their ever getting out again.
There&rsquo;s just a chance that they may try it this
time, though, for they must know how terribly
short the whole Salonika force is of petrol, and
what a real mess things will be left in if they can
pot even one of the two or three oilers in this convoy.
You&rsquo;ll see a merry chase with a kill at the
end of it if they do, I can promise you, for the convoy
is beyond the neck of the bag even now, and if
a single Fritz has come in after them, the string
will be pulled and the rest of the game will be
played out here in the &lsquo;bull-ring.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain had just started telling me how the
game was played, when the W.T.<span class="fnanchor"> <a name="footnotea" id="footnotea"></a><a href="#foota">[A]</a></span> room called him
on the voice-pipe to say that one of the ships of the
convoy had just been torpedoed and was about to
sink, and shortly afterwards a radio was received
from the C.-in-C. ordering the flotilla to proceed to
<!-- Page 3 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>hunt the submarine responsible for the trouble.
Then the officer commanding the division leader
flashed his orders by &ldquo;visual&rdquo; to the several units
of the flotilla, and presently these were spreading
fan-wise to sweep southward toward where, sixty to
a hundred miles away, numerous drifters would be
dropping mile after mile of light nets across the
straits leading out to the open Mediterranean.
Northeastward, where the rising sun was beginning
to prick into vivid whiteness the tents of the
great hospital areas, several sea-planes were circling
upwards; and southeastward, above the dry
brown hills of the Cassandra peninsula, the silver
bag of an air-ship floated across the sky like a soaring
tumble bug. The hounds of the sea and air had
begun to stalk their quarry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a biggish sort of a place to hunt over,&rdquo;
said the captain, as the <i>Spark</i> stood away on a
course that formed the outside left rib of the
flotilla&rsquo;s &ldquo;fan,&rdquo; and took her in to skirt the rocky
coast of Cassandra; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s so many in the
hunt that the chances are all in favour of some
other fellow getting the brush instead of you.
And unless we have the luck to do some of the
flushing ourselves, I won&rsquo;t promise you that the
whole show won&rsquo;t prove no end of a bore; and even
if we do scare him up&mdash;well, there are a good many
more exciting things than dropping &lsquo;ash-cans&rsquo; on
a frightened Fritzie. It won&rsquo;t be a circumstance,
for instance, to that rough house we ran into at the<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
&lsquo;White Tower&rsquo; last night when that boxful of
French &lsquo;blue-devils&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t stop singing &lsquo;Madelon&rsquo;
when the couchee-couchee dancer&rsquo;s turn
began, and her friend, the Russian colonel in the
next box, started to dissolve the Entente by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain broke off suddenly and set the alarm
bell going as a lynx-eyed lookout cut in with &ldquo;Connin&rsquo;
tower o&rsquo; submreen three points on port bow,&rdquo;
and, with much banging of boots on steel decks and
ladders, the ship had gone to &ldquo;Action Stations&rdquo;
before a leisurely mounting recognition rocket revealed
the fact that the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; was a friend,
doubtless a &ldquo;co-huntress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although we were still far from where there was
yet any chance of encountering the U-boat which
had attacked the convoy, there were two or three
alarms in the course of the next hour. The first
was when we altered our course to avoid a torpedo
reported as running to strike our port bow, to discover
an instant later that the doughty <i>Spark</i> was
turning away from a gambolling porpoise. The
second was when some kind of a long-necked sea-bird
rose from a dive about two hundred yards on
the starboard beam and created an effect so like a
finger-periscope with its following &ldquo;feather&rdquo; that
it drew a shell from the foremost gun which all but
blew it out of the water. It was my remarking the
smartness with which this gun was served that led
the captain, when a floating mine was reported a
few minutes later, to order that sinister menace to<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
be destroyed by shell-fire rather than, as usual, by
shots from a rifle. All the guns which would bear
were given an even start in the race to hit the
wickedly horned hemisphere as we brought it
abeam at a range of six or eight hundred yards;
but the lean, keen crew of the pet on the forecastle&mdash;splashing
the target with their first shot
and detonating it with their second&mdash;won in a walk
and left the others nothing but a hundred-feet-high
geyser of smoke-streaked spray tumbling
above a heart of flame to pump their tardier shells
into.</p>

<p>The captain gazed down with a smile of affectionate
pride to where the winners, having trained their
gun back amidships, were wiping its smoky nose,
sponging out its mouth, polishing its sleek barrel,
and patting its shiny breech, for all the world as
though they were grooms and stable-boys and
jockeys performing similar services for the Derby
winner just led back to his stall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not another such four-inch gun&rsquo;s crew
as that one in any ship in the Mediterranean,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;which makes it all the greater pity that
they have never once had a chance to fire a shot at
anything of the enemy&rsquo;s any larger than that Bulgar
bombing plane they cocked up and took a pot at
after he had gone over yesterday. I mean that they
never had a chance as a crew. Individually, I believe
there are two or three of them that have been
through some of the hottest shows in the war. That<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
slender chap there in the blue overall was in the
<i>Killarney</i> when she was shot to pieces and sunk
by German cruisers at Jutland, and I believe his
Number Two&mdash;that one in a singlet, with his sleeves
rolled up and just a bit of a limp&mdash;was in the
<i>Seagull</i> when she was rammed, right in the middle
of an action with the Huns, by both the <i>Bow</i> and
the <i>Wreath</i>. A number of ratings from the <i>Seagull</i>
clambered over the forecastle of the <i>Bow</i> while
the two were locked together, evidently because
they thought their own ship was going down,
while two or three men from the <i>Bow</i> were thrown
by the force of the collision on to the <i>Seagull</i>.
When the two broke loose and drifted apart men
from each of them were left on the other, and by a
rather interesting coincidence, we have right here
in the <i>Spark</i> at this moment representatives of both
batches. They, with two or three other Jutland
&lsquo;veterans&rsquo; who chance also to be in the <i>Spark</i>, call
themselves the &lsquo;Black Marias.&rsquo; Just why, I&rsquo;m not
quite sure, but I believe it has something to do with
their all being finally picked up by one destroyer
and carried back to harbour like a lot of drunks
after a night&rsquo;s spree. And, to hear them talk of
it when they get together, that is the spirit in
which they affect to regard a phase of the Jutland
battle which wiped out some scores of their
mates and two or three of the destroyers of their
flotilla. Talking with one of them alone, he will
occasionally condescend to speak of the serious side<!-- Page 7 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of the show, but their joint reminiscences, in the
constant by-play of banter, are more suggestive of
tumultuous &lsquo;nights of gladness&rsquo; on the beach at
Port Said or Rio than the most murderous spasm
of night fighting in the whose course of naval history.
You&rsquo;ve got a long and probably tiresome day
ahead of you. Perhaps it might ease the monotony
a bit if you had a yarn with two or three of them.
They&rsquo;ll be bored stiff standing by in this blazing
sun with small prospects of anything turning up,
and probably easier to draw out than at most times.
Gains, there by the foremost gun, would be a good
one for a starter. There is no doubt of his having
seen some minutes of the real thing in the <i>Killarney</i>.
Only don&rsquo;t try a frontal attack on him.
Just saunter along and start talking about anything
else on earth than Jutland and the <i>Killarney</i>,
and then lead him round by degrees.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We were just passing the riven wreck of a large
freighter as I sidled inconsequently along to the
forecastle, and the strange way in which the stern
appeared to be stirring to the barely perceptible
swell gave ample excuse for turning to the crew of
the foremost gun for a possible explanation. It
was Leading Seaman Gains, as incisive of speech as
he was quick of movement, who replied, and I
recognized him at once as a youth of force and personality,
one of the type to whom the broadened opportunities
for quick promotion offered the Lower<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Deck through the war has given a new outlook on
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a tramp with a cargo of American
mules for the Serbs, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she was
submarined two or three miles off shore. The
mouldie cracked her up amidships, but her back
didn&rsquo;t break till she grounded on that sand spit
there. At first her stern sank till her poop was
awash at high tide&mdash;there&rsquo;s only a few feet rise
and fall here, as you probably know, sir&mdash;but when
the bodies of the mules that had been drowned
&rsquo;tween decks began to swell they blocked up all
the holes and finally generated so much gas that
the increased buoyancy lifted the keel of the stern
half clear of the bottom and left it free to move
with the seas. I have heard they intend to blow
out her bottom and sink her proper for fear that
end of her might float off in a storm and turn
derelict.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That story was, as I learned later, substantially
true, but it had just enough of the fantastic in it to
tempt the twinkling eyed &ldquo;Number Two&rdquo; to a bit
of embroidery on his own account. He was the one
with the muscular forearms and the slight limp.
The suggestion of &ldquo;New World&rdquo; accent in his
speech was traceable, he subsequently told me, to
the many years he had spent on the Esquimault
station in British Columbia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do say, sir,&rdquo; he said solemnly, rubbing
hard at an imaginary patch of inferior refulgency<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
on the shining breech of his gun, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s that
light and jumpy with mule-gas, after the sun&rsquo;s been
beating on her poop all day, that she lifts right up
in the air and tugs at her moorings like a kite
balloon. And there&rsquo;s one buzz winging round that
they&rsquo;re going to run a pipe-line to her end and use
the gas for inflating&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gains, evidently feeling that there were limits to
which the credulity of a landsman should be imposed
upon, cut in coldly and crushingly with:
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the only old wreck &rsquo;round here that they
could draw on for &lsquo;mule-gas&rsquo; if there&rsquo;s ever need
of it, my boy; and as for her rising under her own
power&mdash;well, if she ever goes as far as you did
under yours the night you jumped from the <i>Seagull</i>
to the <i>Bow</i> I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gusty guffaw that drowned the rest of Gains&rsquo;
broadside left us all on good terms, and, by a
happy chance, with the &ldquo;Jutland ice&rdquo; already
broken. Number Two, joining heartily in the
laugh, said that, &ldquo;nifty&rdquo; as was his jump from
the <i>Seagull</i> to the <i>Bow</i>, it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;starter&rdquo; to
the &ldquo;double back-action-summerset&rdquo; with which
Jock Campbell was chucked from the <i>Bow</i> to the
<i>Seagull</i>. &ldquo;We played a sort of &lsquo;Pussy-Wants-a-Corner&rsquo;
exchange, Jock and me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
Jock was Number Four or &lsquo;Trainer&rsquo; of the crew of
one of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle guns of the <i>Bow</i>, and I was the
same in the <i>Seagull</i>. We didn&rsquo;t quite land in each
other&rsquo;s place when the wallop came, but it wasn&rsquo;t<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
far from it; and we each finished the scrap in the
other guy&rsquo;s ship. You might pike aft and try to
get a yarn out of Jock when &lsquo;Pack up!&rsquo; sounds.
He&rsquo;s a close-mouthed tyke, though, and if you can
get him to tell how he played the human proj, you&rsquo;ll
be doing more&rsquo;n anyone else has been able to pull
off down to now. He&rsquo;s half clam and half sphinx,
I think Jock is, and that makes a &lsquo;dour lad&rsquo; when
crossed with a &lsquo;Glasgie&rsquo; strain. Which makes it
all the sadder to have him qualify for membership
in the &lsquo;Black Marias,&rsquo; and me, because I finished
in the <i>Bow</i>, froze out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him that I would gladly have a try at
Jock later, provided only that he would first tell me
what happened in his own case, adding that it
wasn&rsquo;t every British sailor who could claim the distinction
of fighting the Hun from two different
ships within the hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been a darned sight better for me
if I&rsquo;d confined my fighting to <i>one</i> ship,&rdquo; he replied
with a wry smile, &ldquo;and it was mighty little fighting
I got out of it anyhow. But sure, I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I saw of the fracas, and then you can take a chance
at Jock. It was along toward midnight, and the
<i>Seagull</i> was steaming in &lsquo;line ahead&rsquo; with her half
of the flotilla. The <i>Killarney</i> and <i>Firebrand</i> was
leading us, with the <i>Wreath</i> and one or two others
astern. I was at &lsquo;action station&rsquo; with the crew of
the foremost gun, and keeping my eye peeled all
round, for some of the ships astern had just been<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
popping away at some Hun destroyers they had
reported. All of a sudden I saw the officers on the
bridge peering out to starboard, and there, coming
up astern of us and steering a converging course, I
saw the first, and right after, the second and third,
of a line of some big lumping ships&mdash;some kind of
cruisers. All of the flotilla must have thought they
was our own ships, for no one challenged or fired
all the time they came drawing up past us, making
four or five knots more than the seventeen we were
doing.</p>

<h4>A BROADSIDE AT NIGHT AT THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND</h4>

<p>&ldquo;When the leader was about abreast the <i>Killarney</i>
and inside of half a mile range, she flashed
on some red and green lights, switched on her
searchlights and opened fire. Ship for ship, the
Huns were just about even with our line now, and
the <i>Firebrand</i> and <i>Seagull</i> must have launched
mouldies at the second and third cruisers at near
the same moment. Hitting at that range ships
running on parallel courses was a cinch, and both
slugs slipped home. It was some sight, those two
spouts of fire and smoke shooting up together, and
by the light of &rsquo;em I could see that the <i>Firebrand&rsquo;s</i>
bag was a four-funneller, and ours a three. The
first one keeled right over and began to sink at
once, but the one our mouldie hit went staggering
on, though down by the stern and with a heavy
list to port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would sure have put the kibosh on this one
with the next torpedo if we hadn&rsquo;t had to turn<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sharp to port to avoid the <i>Killarney</i> just then, and
so missed our last chance to do something in &lsquo;the
Great War.&rsquo; I lost sight of the <i>Firebrand</i> and took
it for granted she had been blown up. It was not
till a week afterwards that we learned she had
turned the other way, engaged one Hun cruiser
with gunfire, rammed another, just missed being
rammed by a third, and finally crawled into port
under her own steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Seagull</i> came under the searchlights of the
leading Hun cruiser for a few seconds as she came
up abreast of the burning <i>Killarney</i>, and then the
smoke and steam cut off the beam and I was blind
as a bat for a minute. The <i>Killarney</i> had been left
astern when I looked for her again, and seemed all
in, with fires all over her and only one gun yapping
away on her quarter-deck. I didn&rsquo;t know it at the
time, but it was my old college friend, Gains, here,
who was passing the projes, for that pert little
piece. You&rsquo;d never think it to look at him, would
you?&rdquo; Gains, feigning to discover something
which needed adjustment in the training mechanism,
ducked his head behind the breech of his gun
at this juncture, and did not bob up again until a
resumption of the yarn deflected the centre of
interest back to Number Two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turning to port took us over into the line of the
other Division, and the first thing I knew the <i>Seagull</i>
had poked in and taken station astern of the
<i>Bow</i>, which was leading it. Just then some Hun
ship, I think it was the same one that strafed the<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<i>Killarney</i>, opened on the <i>Bow</i> from starboard, the
bursting shell splashing all over her from the funnels
right for&rsquo;ard. <i>Bow</i> turned sharp to port to
try to shake off the searchlights, and <i>Seagull</i>
altered at same time to keep from turning in her
wake and running into the shells she was side-stepping.
All of a sudden I saw another destroyer
steering right across our bows, and to keep from
ramming her the captain altered back to starboard.
That cleared her stern by an eyelash, but
the next second I saw that it was now only a question
of whether <i>Seagull</i> would ram <i>Bow</i>, or <i>Bow</i>
would ram <i>Seagull</i>. How a dished and done-for
quartermaster, falling across his wheel as he died,
decided it in favour of <i>Bow</i> I did not learn till later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hun shells were tearing up the water
astern of the <i>Bow</i> for half a minute as she began to
close us; then they stopped, and the smash came
at the end of five or ten seconds of dead quiet. It
was pitchy dark, with the flicker of fires on the
deck of the <i>Bow</i> making trembly red splotches in
the smoke and steam. A sight I saw by the light
of one of those fires just before the wallop is my
main memory of all the hell I saw in the next
quarter hour. It has lasted just as if it was burned
into my brain with a hot iron, and it figures in one
way or other in every nightmare I&rsquo;ve had since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The humorous twinkle in the corner of the man&rsquo;s
eye, which had persisted during all of his recital up<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to this point, suddenly died out, and he was staring
into nothingness straight ahead of him, where the
picture his memory conjured up seemed to hang in
projection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just before we struck,&rdquo; he went on,
speaking slowly, and in an awed voice strangely in
contrast to the rather bantering tone he had
affected before; &ldquo;and the bows of the <i>Bow</i> were
only ten or fifteen yards off, driving down on us in
the middle of the double wave of greeny-grey foam
they were throwing on both sides. By the light of
a fire burning in the wreck of her bridge I saw a lot
of bodies lying round on her fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;, and right then
one of them picked itself up and stood on its feet.
It was a whole man from the chest up, and from a
bit below the waist down, but&mdash;for all that I could
see&mdash;nothing between. Of course, there must have
been an unbroken backbone to make a frame that
would stand up at all, but all the shot-away part
was in shadow, so I saw nothing from the chest to
the hips. It was just as if the head and shoulders
were floating in the air. I remember &rsquo;specially
that it held its cap crushed tight in one of its hands.
The face had a kind of a calm look on it at first.
Then it turned down and seemed to look at what
was gone, and I could see the mouth open as if to
holler. Then the crash came, and I didn&rsquo;t see it
again till they were stitching it up in canvas with
a fire-bar before dropping it overside the next day.
I learned then that an 8-inch shell had done the<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
trick&mdash;rather a big order for one man to try to
stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, blinked once or twice as
though to shut out the gruesome vision, and when
he resumed the corners of a sheepish grin were
cutting into and erasing the lines of horror that
had come to his face in describing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use of my claiming that I was
thrown over to the <i>Bow</i> by the shock,&rdquo; he continued,
the twinkle flickering up in his eye again,
&ldquo;like Jock was pitched over to the <i>Seagull</i>. That
<i>did</i> happen to three or four ratings from the <i>Seagull</i>,
though, one signalman and a chap standing
look-out being chucked all the way from the fore
bridge. But in the case of most of the twenty-three
of us who found ourselves adorning the <i>Bow&rsquo;s</i>
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; when the ships broke away, it was the result
of a &lsquo;flap&rsquo; started by some ijits yelling that we
were cut in two and going down. What was more
natural, then, with the <i>Bow</i> looming up there big
and solid&mdash;she was a good sight larger than the
<i>Gull</i>&mdash;that the &lsquo;rats&rsquo; should leave the sinking ship
for one that looked like she might go on floating for
a while. I&rsquo;m not trying to make an excuse for what
happened, but only explaining it. The Lord knows
we paid a big enough price for it, anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Bow</i> hit us like a thousand o&rsquo; bricks just
before the bridge, and cut more than half-way
through to the port side. The shock seemed to
knock the deck right out from under my feet, and I<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was slammed hard against the starboard wire rail,
which must have kept me from being ditched then
and there. A lot of the wreckage from the <i>Bow&rsquo;s</i>
shot-up bridge showered down on the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i>
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;, but my friend, Jock Campbell, floated down
on the side toward the bridge, so I had no chance
to welcome him. From where I was when I pulled
up to my feet, it looked as if the <i>Bow</i> only lacked
a few feet from cutting all the way through us, and
as soon as I saw her screws beating up the sea as
she tried to go astern, I had the feeling that the
whole fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; of the <i>Gull</i> must break off and sink
as soon as the &lsquo;plug&rsquo; was pulled out. I was still
sitting tight, though, when that howl started that
we were already breaking off and going down, and&mdash;well,
I joined the rush, and it was just as easy
as stepping from a launch to the side of a quay.
I&rsquo;m not trying to make out a case for anybody, but
the little bunch of us who climbed to the <i>Bow</i> from
that half-cut-off fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; sure had more excuse than
them that swarmed over from aft and leaving the
main solid lump of the ship. But we none of us
had no business clambering off till we were
ordered. In doing that we were only asking for
trouble, and we sure got it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; of the <i>Bow</i> was all buckled up in
waves from the collision, and there was a slipperiness
underfoot that I twigged didn&rsquo;t come from sea
water just as soon as I stumbled over the bodies
lying round the wreck of the port foremost gun<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
where I climbed over. We couldn&rsquo;t get aft very
well on account of the smashed bridge, and so the
bunch of us just huddled up there like a lot of
sheep, waiting for some one to tell us what to do.
The captain had already left the bridge and was
conning her from aft&mdash;or possibly the engine-room&mdash;at
this time. From the way she was shaking and
swinging, I knew they were trying to worry her
nose out, putting the engines astern, now one and
now the other. The clanking and the grinding was
something fierce, but pretty soon she began to
back clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just a minute or two before the <i>Bow</i> tore
free from her that the poor old <i>Gull</i> got the wallop
that was finally responsible for doing her in. This
was from a destroyer that came charging up out of
the night and wasn&rsquo;t able to turn in time to clear
the <i>Gull&rsquo;s</i> stern, with the result that she went
right through it. Her sharp stem slashed through
the quarterdeck like it was cutting bully beef, slicing
five or ten feet of it clean off, so that it fell
clear and sank. The jar of it ran through the whole
length of the <i>Seagull</i>, and I felt the quick kick of it
even in the <i>Bow</i>. In fact, I think the shock of this
second collision was the thing that finally broke
them clear of the first, for it was just after that I
saw the wreck of the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> bridge begin to slide
away along the <i>Bow&rsquo;s</i> starboard bow, as what was
left of it wriggled clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t much of a look I had at this last<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
destroyer, but I had a hunch even then that she was
the <i>Wreath</i>, who had been our next astern. It
wasn&rsquo;t till a long time afterward that I learned for
certain that this was a fact. The <i>Wreath</i> had followed
us out of line when we turned to clear the
stopped and burning <i>Killarney</i>, and then, when we
messed up with the <i>Bow</i>, not having time to go
round, she had to take a short cut through the tail
feathers of the poor old <i>Seagull</i>. Then she tore
right on hell-for-leather hunting for Huns, for it&rsquo;s
each ship for herself and the devil take the hind-most
in the destroyer game more than in any
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the water boiling into the hole in the side
of the <i>Seagull</i> as the <i>Bow</i> backed away, and expected
every minute to see the for&rsquo;rard end of her
break off and sink. But beyond settling down a lot
by the head, she still held together and still
floated. Bulkheads fore and aft were holding, it
looked like, and there was still enough &lsquo;ship&rsquo; left
to carry on with. I could hardly believe my eyes
when I saw the blurred wreck of her begin to gather
stern way. But it was a fact. Though her rudder,
of course, was smashed or carried away, and though
she couldn&rsquo;t go ahead without breaking in two, she
was still able to move through the water, and perhaps
even to steer a rough sort of course with her
screws. As it turned out, it wouldn&rsquo;t have made
no difference whether we was in her or no; but
just the same it was blooming awful, standing<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
there and knowing that you&rsquo;d left her while she
still had a kick in her. The ragged line where some
of the wrecked stern of her showed against the
phosphorescent glow of the churn of her screws&mdash;that
was my good-bye peep at all that was left of
the good old <i>Seagull</i>. Gains here, or Jock Campbell,
can tell you what her finish was. I don&rsquo;t like
to talk about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of us tried to get aft as soon as we were
clear of the <i>Seagull</i>, but couldn&rsquo;t make the grade
over the wreck of the bridge. As all the officers
and men who had been there had either been killed
or wounded, or had gone to the after steering position
they were now conning her from, we were as
much cut off from them as though we were on
another craft altogether. All the crews of her
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; guns&mdash;or such of them as were still alive&mdash;were
in the same fix. So we just bunched up there
in the dark and waited. Some of the wounded were
in beastly shape, but there wasn&rsquo;t much to be done
for them, even in the way of first aid. Some shipmates
of other times drifted together in the darkness,
and I remember &rsquo;specially&mdash;it was while I
was trying to tie up some guy&rsquo;s scalp with the
sleeve of my shirt&mdash;hearing one of them telling
another of a wool mat he had just made, all with
ravellings from &lsquo;Harry Freeman.&rsquo;<span class="fnanchor"> <a name="footnoteb" id="footnoteb"></a><a href="#footb">[B]</a></span> Funny how
it&rsquo;s the little things like that a man remembers.
<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>The gunner whose head I bound up was telling me
just how the <i>Bow</i> happened to be strafed, but it
went in one ear and out of the other.</p>

<a href="#footnoteb">[B]</a> The bluejackets&rsquo; name for knitted woollen gifts from friends on the
beach.
</div>

<p>&ldquo;But the queerest thing was me hearing some
guy lying all messed up on the deck muttering
something about <i>skookum kluches</i>, and some more
Chinook <i>wa-wa</i> that I knew he couldn&rsquo;t have picked
up anywhere else but from serving in a &lsquo;T.B.D.&rsquo;
working up and down the old Inland Passage from
Vancouver Island. I felt my way to where he was
huddled up in the wreck of a smashed gun, told him
that I was another <i>tilicum</i> from the &rsquo;Squimalt
Base, and asked him what ship he had been there
in. I knew there was a good chance that we&rsquo;d been
mates in the old <i>Virago</i>, and there even seemed a
familiar sound to his voice. But I wasn&rsquo;t fated
ever to find out. He just kept on muttering, slipping
up on some words as if something was wrong
with his mouth, and I didn&rsquo;t dare light a match, of
course. When I tried to ease him up a bit by lifting
so he&rsquo;d lie straight&mdash;well, all of him didn&rsquo;t
seem to come along when I started dragging by his
shoulders. I never did find what was wrong
with him, for right then new troubles of my own
set in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was still down on my knees trying to locate
what was missing with this poor guy, when&mdash;out of
the corner of my eye, for it was near behind me&mdash;I
spotted the flash of a ship challenging. <i>Bow</i> challenged
back&mdash;from somewhere aft&mdash;and then what<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
I piped at once for a Hun destroyer switched on
searchlights and opened fire. She was about two
cables off on our port quarter, heading right for us
and blazing away with one or two guns, probably
all that would bear on that course. A second destroyer,
right astern her, didn&rsquo;t seem to be firing. I
heard the bang and saw the flash of two or three
shells bursting somewhere amidships, and then the
<i>Bow&rsquo;s</i> port after gun began to reply. The crews
of all the others were knocked out, and so were
the searchlights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between the twenty-three from the <i>Seagull</i> and
what were left of the <i>Bow&rsquo;s</i> fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; guns&rsquo; crews,
there must have been thirty-five to forty men
bunched together there for&rsquo;rard of the wreck of the
bridge. When the firing started, the whole kaboodle
of us did what you&rsquo;re always under orders to
do when you have nothing to stand up for&mdash;laid
down. Or, rather, we just tumbled into a heap like
a pile of dead rabbits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went sprawling over the poor devil I was trying
to help, and there were two or three on top of
me. Into that squirming hump of human flesh one
of the Hun&rsquo;s projes landed kerplump. It didn&rsquo;t
hit me at all, that one, but I can feel yet the kind
of heave the whole bunch gave as it ploughed
through. Then it was like warm water was being
thrown on the pile in buckets, but it wasn&rsquo;t till I
had scrambled out and found it sticky that I
twigged it was blood.<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad as it was, it might have been a lot worse.
There hadn&rsquo;t been enough resistance to explode the
proj, and so it killed only four or five and wounded,
maybe, twice that, where it would have scoured
every man jack of us into the sea and Kingdom
Come if it had gone off. The next one found something
in the wreck of the bridge hard enough to
crack it off though, and it was a ragged scrap of
its casing that drove in to the point of my hip and
put a kink in my rolling gait that I&rsquo;ve never quite
shaken out yet. It wasn&rsquo;t much of a hurt to what
it gave some, though, &rsquo;specially a lad that caught
the main kick of it and got ditched to starboard,
some of him going under the wire rail, and some
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Huns couldn&rsquo;t have known how down and
out the <i>Bow</i> really was, for there was nothing in
the world but that one port gun to prevent their
closing and polishing her off. The chances are they
recognised her class, knew she was more than a
match for the pair of them if she was right, and
were glad to get off with no more&rsquo;n an exchange of
shots in passing. That was the end of the fighting
for the <i>Bow</i>, and about time, too. Her bows were
stove in, all the fore part of her was full of water,
her bridge was smashed and useless, her W.T. and
searchlights were finished, all but one gun was out
of action, and&mdash;when they came to count noses
next day&mdash;forty-two of her crew were dead. Far
from looking for more trouble, it was now only a<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
question of making harbour, and even that&mdash;as it
turned out&mdash;was touch-and-go for two days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was about one in the morning when that
brush with the destroyers came off, and after that
there was nothing to do but hang on till daylight
and they could clear a way to reach us from abaft
the wreckage of the bridge. It was pretty awful,
ticking off the minutes there in the darkness. A
good many of the worst knocked about were talking
a bit wild, but I never heard the guy with the
Chinook <i>wa-wa</i> again. He must have died and been
pitched over while I was being bandaged up. I <i>did</i>
hear the &lsquo;wool-mat-maker&rsquo; yapping again, though,
saying how &lsquo;target cloth&rsquo; was better to work on
than canvas, and describing how to pull the stuff
through in a loose loop, and then cut them so that
they bunched up in &lsquo;soft, puffy balls.&rsquo; Seems like
I was cussing him when I dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have bled a good deal, for I slept like a
log for four or five hours, and woke up only when
some one turned me over and began to finger my
hip. It was broad daylight, but hazy, and the sun
just showing through. Some of the wounded had
already been carried aft, and they were mostly dead
ones that were lying around. These were being
sewed up in canvas to get ready to bury. I
thought there was something familiar in the face
of one guy I saw them laying out and sort of collecting
together, but it wasn&rsquo;t till later that it
suddenly came to me that he was the one I had seen<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
by firelight when he stood up and looked at himself
where he&rsquo;d been shot in two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two guys who bundled me up in a &lsquo;Neil
Robertson&rsquo; stretcher and packed me aft, picking
their way over and through the wreckage, were
both all bound up with rags, and so was about
every one else I saw. They took me below into the
wardroom, and then, because that was full up, on
to some officer&rsquo;s cabin, where they found a place
for me on the deck. After a while, a little dark guy&mdash;he
was also a good deal bandaged, and so
splashed with blood that I didn&rsquo;t notice at the
time he was a sick bay steward&mdash;came in, washed
my wound out with some dope that smarted like
the devil, and tied it up. He worked like a streak
of greased lightning, and then went on to some one
else. That chap was Pridmore, and, let me tell you,
he was the real &lsquo;top-liner&rsquo; of all the heroes of the
<i>Bow</i>. The surgeon had been killed at the first
salvo the night before, leaving no one but him to
carry on through all the hell that followed. And
some way&mdash;God knows how&mdash;he did it; yes, even
though he was wounded three or four times himself,
and though he had to go without sleep for
more&rsquo;n two days to find time to dress and tend the
thirty or forty crocks he had on his hands. He was
sure the star turn, that Pridmore, and I was glad
to read the other day that they had given him the
D.S.M. Not that he&rsquo;d have all he deserved if they
hung medals all over him; but&mdash;well, a guy likes<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to have something to show that what he&rsquo;s done
hasn&rsquo;t been lost in the shuffle entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made an entry of &ldquo;Pridmore, sick bay steward,
<i>Bow</i>,&rdquo; in my notebook for future reference, and as
I was returning it to my pocket a sudden list to
starboard, accompanied by a throbbing grind of
the helm, heralded a sharp alteration of course.
Round she went through ten or twelve points,
finally to steady and stand away on a course that
seemed to lead toward the dip in the skyline between
the jagged range of mountains back of
Monastir and the point where a lowering bank of
cirro-cumuli hid the ancient abode of the gods on
the snow-capped summit of Olympus. On Number
Two assuring me that his yarn was spun, that there
was nothing more to it save an attempt he had
made, in spite of his wound, to get into a fight
that started when some of the wounded were hissed
by a gang of dockyard &ldquo;mateys&rdquo;&mdash;I clambered
back to the bridge to learn the significance of the
new move. I still wanted to hear Gains&rsquo; story of
the <i>Killarney</i>, but I had already sized him up
sufficiently to know that he was not the type of man
who would unbosom himself before his mates.
With him, I knew, I should have to watch my
chances, and endeavour to have a yarn alone.
Number Two&rsquo;s parting injunction was to &ldquo;try and
have a go at Jock Campbell, &lsquo;the human proj.&rsquo;
Jock&rsquo;s the guy at the after gun that looks like he
was rigged out for deep-sea diving,&rdquo; he said.<!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
&ldquo;Most likely he&rsquo;ll only growl at you at first, but if
he won&rsquo;t warm up any other way, try him with a
yarn about a skirt. He&rsquo;s &lsquo;verra fond o&rsquo; a braw
lass,&rsquo; is Jock Campbell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our alteration of course, the captain told me,
was the consequence of an order received by wireless
directing him to cross over and hunt down a
strip along the western shore of the gulf which was
not being covered by the present formation of the
division. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a signal stating that they&rsquo;re
on the track of one U-boat, and there may be something
to make them think another has slipped
further along and is lying in ambush for the convoy
about off Volo. They&rsquo;re evidently keeping the
rest of the division heading in to meet the convoy
itself.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>Spark</i> stood on to the north-west until the
Vardar marshes showed as an olive-green rim
around the bend of the gulf, before turning southward
again to skirt the steep shingle-strewn beach
along the alluvial &ldquo;fans&rdquo; spreading down to the
sea from the base of Olympus. The wild-looking
Thessalian shepherds were just driving their motley
flocks down to the open foreshore to freshen up
in the rising midday sea breeze, and it was when I
assured Jock Campbell (where I found him leaning
on the breech of the after gun and staring landwards
with his bushy brows puckered in the incredulous
scowl of a man who can&rsquo;t credit the evidence<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
of his own eyes) that it was an actual fact that the
fuzzy black sheep were wading in and drinking&mdash;if
sparingly&mdash;of the salt water, that a basis of conversation
was finally established. Up to that
moment he had given no sign that any of my carelessly
thrown out tentatives had penetrated to his
ears through the &ldquo;telepad&rdquo; rig-out which established
his connection with the gunnery control.
But when, bringing my lips close to his nearest
&ldquo;ear-muff,&rdquo; I shouted that I had come up along
that coast from Lharissa but a few weeks previously
by motor and pack-train, and that, in lieu
of any fresh water for many miles in either direction,
I had actually seen the sheep and goats
drinking in flocks from the sea, the look of hostile
suspicion in his eyes was replaced by one of friendly
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, y&rsquo;u dinna say so?&rdquo; he ejaculated,
easing away the edge of the helmet over one ear;
&ldquo;the puir wee beasties!&rdquo; Then he volunteered
that he had once kept from freezing to death in a
snowstorm on Ben Nevis by curling up among his
sheep, and I told how I had once sheared sheep
(not mentioning it was for only half a day, and
that my &ldquo;clip&rdquo; was composed of about equal parts
mutton and wool) on a back blocks station in
Queensland. Then he described how he had seen a
big merino ram butt a Ford car off the road up
Thurso way, and I&mdash;with more finesse than
veracity&mdash;capped that with a yarn of how I had<!-- Page 28 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
seen a flock of Macedonian sheep blown up by a
Bulgarian air-bomb, and how one of them had
landed unhurt upon a passing motor lorry load of
forage&mdash;and gone right on grazing! I reckoned
that might be calculated to remind Jock of something
of the same character which had befallen him
on a certain memorable occasion, and I was not
disappointed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twas verra like wha&rsquo; cam ma way on the nicht
the <i>Bow</i> rammed the <i>Seagull</i> at the fecht aff Jutland,&rdquo;
he commented instantly, with no trace of
suspicion in his voice. &ldquo;Wad ye care to hear
aboot it? Ye wud? Weel, then&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; As brief,
as direct and to the point was the plain unvarnished
tale Jock Campbell told me the while a
noon-day storm awoke reverberant echoes of the
Jovian thunders in the snow-caverns of Olympus
and the <i>Spark</i> hunted down through the jade green
waters of the Thessalian coast for a U-boat that
was supposed to be lurking in their lucent depths
&ldquo;somewhere off Volo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah was at ma action station at the port foremost
gun,&rdquo; he began, wiping his perspiring brow
with a wad of greasy waste, which left an undulant
trail of oil from the recoil cylinder in its wake,
&ldquo;when we gaed bang into a line o&rsquo; big Hun
cru&rsquo;sers, and we lat blaze at them and them at us.
The range was short, and wi&rsquo; their serchlichts
lichten us up oor position wasna that Ah wad ca&rsquo;
verra pleasant. Up gaed a Hun cru&rsquo;ser in a spoort<!-- Page 29 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
o&rsquo; flame and reek, hit, Ah thocht, by a mouldie
launched by oor next astern. Ah was fair jumpin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; joy at the sicht, when a hale salvo o&rsquo; screechin&rsquo;
projes cam bang inta the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl. Ah minded the
licht o&rsquo; them mair than the soun&rsquo;, which was na
great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Huns had switched aff their serchlichts
when they opened fire, so that noo the projes was
bursting in inky mirk. I doubtna oor midships and
after guns was firing, but na the foremost, for Ah
dinna mind being blinded by their licht afore the
Hun projes gan bursting. My ain gun wudna bear
on the Huns, so Ah was just standing by for the
time, ready to train if we turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twa salvos cam&mdash;maybe frae twa different
cru&rsquo;sers&mdash;ane after the ither, wi&rsquo; aboot half a
meenit atween. Ye ken that the licht o&rsquo; a shell-burst
is ower afore ye can even think, and a&rsquo; the
furst ane showed me was just the gun crews,
standin&rsquo;, and bracin&rsquo; themsel&rsquo;s like when a big sea
braks inboard. It was ower like a flash o&rsquo; lichtnin,
and the licht had gone oot afore Ah saw anybody
blown up or knocked oot. But Ah felt a michty
blast o&rsquo; air and an awfu&rsquo; shaikin o&rsquo; the deck, and
then the bang o&rsquo; lumps o&rsquo; projes dingin&rsquo; &rsquo;gainst the
bridge and smackin&rsquo; through bodies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flash o&rsquo; the burst o&rsquo; the second salvo tellt
me what havoc the first had wrocht, but by noo ma
een was licht-blind and Ah cudna see weel. The
sta&rsquo;bo&rsquo;d gun was twisht oot o&rsquo; shape, and a&rsquo; the<!-- Page 30 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
crew but ane were strechit on the deck. To a&rsquo;
appearance that lad had been laid oot wi&rsquo; the ithers,
but noo he was puin himsel&rsquo; to his feet and crawlin&rsquo;
up the wreck o&rsquo; the gun when a proj frae the second
salvo burst richt alow him. By the flash Ah saw
him flyin&rsquo; inta the air, and&mdash;by the licht o&rsquo; anither
flash a bittie efter&mdash;then his corp, wi&rsquo; twa or three
ithers, gang ower the side. A lump o&rsquo; that last
proj carried awa&rsquo; the Number Wan o&rsquo; ma ain gun,
and, onlike some o&rsquo; the ithers, not a bit o&rsquo; him was
left ahint. Ah mesel&rsquo; was knockit flat, but wasna
much the worse for a&rsquo; that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the hinmost Ah saw o&rsquo; the Huns for
that nicht, and the last I mind o&rsquo; the <i>Bow</i> was the
dead and deein&rsquo; wha covert the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;, wi&rsquo; the licht
o&rsquo; the fires burnin&rsquo; aft flickerin&rsquo; ower them. Then
cam&rsquo; a cry frae the bridge that a &rsquo;stroyer was closin&rsquo;
us to port, and then Ah mind hearin&rsquo; the captain
shoutin&rsquo; an order ower and ower, like he wasna
bein&rsquo; answered frae the ither end o&rsquo; the voice-pipe.
&lsquo;Hard-a-port!&rsquo; he roared, but weel micht he shout
for ay, for the qua&rsquo;termaster, wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; on the signal
bridge, was dead by noo, and the helm was left
jammed hard-a-sta&rsquo;bo&rsquo;d.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Ah felt her shudder as the engines went
full speed astern, and Ah got to ma feet in time to
see she was headin&rsquo; straicht for the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; o&rsquo; a
T.B.D. that was steerin&rsquo; cross her bows. And
richt after that she must ha&rsquo; struck wi&rsquo; a michty
crash. The next thing Ah mindit&mdash;weel, Ah didna<!-- Page 31 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mind much save that I was lyin&rsquo; on ma back in a
sort o&rsquo; narrow way atween twa high wa&rsquo;s, wi&rsquo; a
turrible pain in ma back and mony sea-boots
trampin&rsquo; ower ma face. The bashin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the boots
didna hurt me, for Ah was kind o&rsquo; dazed; but Ah
seem to mind turnin&rsquo; ma face to the wa&rsquo;, just like
ye do whan the flees are botherin&rsquo; ye in the
mornin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brocht me roun&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, was the
shock that Ah got whan that wa&rsquo; &rsquo;gan to shak&rsquo; up
and doon, and then slid richt awa&rsquo;, leavin&rsquo; me
hingin&rsquo; ower the brink o&rsquo; a black hole, wi&rsquo; water
souchin&rsquo; aboot the bottom o&rsquo;t. &rsquo;Twas like wakin&rsquo;
oot o&rsquo; a bad dream and findin&rsquo; that the warst o&rsquo; it
was true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah was too groggy to ken richt awa&rsquo; that the
<i>Bow</i> had rammed anither ship and that Ah had
been pitched oot o&rsquo; her into the wan she&rsquo;d hit.
Quite natteral, Ah thocht masel&rsquo; still in the <i>Bow</i>,
seem&rsquo; that Ah cud be nae mair use on the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;,
which was a&rsquo; smashed and rippit up and drappin&rsquo;
to bits, Ah thocht that Ah ought to run aft to see
if Ah could gie a haun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when Ah tried to get up, Ah fund the bane
o&rsquo; ma spine was so sair that Ah cudna stand
straicht, and a&rsquo; Ah cud do was to craw&rsquo; and stagger
alang. Every mon Ah knockit agin, and every bit
of wreck Ah felt ower, sent me sprawlin&rsquo;. Whan I
fund that there was no so mony funnels as Ah
minded afore, and whan Ah cudna find the W.T.<!-- Page 32 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
hoose, Ah thocht that they had been shot awa&rsquo;.
Findin&rsquo; a crew at stations by a midships gun, Ah
speired if they was short o&rsquo; hauns. They said they
werna, so Ah gaed alang aft, lookin&rsquo; for a chance
to be useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah was thinkin&rsquo; to masel&rsquo;, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; little
shot up&rsquo; (for ye ken Ah had expectit her to be a&rsquo; to
bits frae the way Ah&rsquo;d heard the projes burstin&rsquo;
ahint the bridge), whan a syren gae a michty
shriek a&rsquo; most at ma lug, and Ah turned to see
anither T.B.D., spootin&rsquo; fire frae her funnels and
throwin&rsquo; a double bow wave higher&rsquo;n her fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;,
headin&rsquo; richt inta us. Ah cud see that her helm
was hard-a-port by the way her wake was boilin&rsquo;,
but it was nae guid. She turned enough to keep
frae rammin&rsquo; us midships, but she cudna miss oor
stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah had just been tellt by ane o&rsquo; the after gun&rsquo;s
crew to get oot o&rsquo; the wa&rsquo; (they not bein&rsquo; short o&rsquo;
hauns), whan this new craft hove inta sicht. At
first it lookit like she wad cut thro&rsquo; for&rsquo;ard o&rsquo; me,
leavin&rsquo; me ahint to drown in the wreck o&rsquo; the
stern. Then Ah thocht she was comin&rsquo; richt at me,
and Ah started crawlin&rsquo; back to whaur Ah had
come frae. But she keepit turnin&rsquo; and turnin&rsquo;, so
that she hit at last richt abaft the after gun. Ah
fell a&rsquo; in a heap at the shock, and, tho&rsquo; Ah was a
guid ten feet frae whaur her stem cut in, the bulge
o&rsquo; her crunched into the quarterdeck till she
passed sae close that suthin&rsquo; stickin&rsquo; oot frae her<!-- Page 33 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
side&mdash;it micht hae been the lip o&rsquo; a mouldie-tube,
Ah&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;gae ma puir back a sair dig, and
there Ah was amang the mess left o&rsquo; the gun and
its crew. Ah was near to bein&rsquo; dragged owerboard
after that T.B.D., and when she was gone Ah fund
masel&rsquo;&mdash;for the second time in ane night&mdash;hangin&rsquo;
ower the raggit edge o&rsquo; a black hole listenin&rsquo; to the
swish o&rsquo; ragin&rsquo; waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then, gin that and ma half-broken back
werna enough for ony mon, Ah hear some ane
shoutit that they thocht that last rammin&rsquo; had done
in the auld <i>Seagull</i>, and that the time wad soon
come to &rsquo;bandon ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Seagull!</i>&rsquo; says Ah; &lsquo;dinna ye ken this ship is
the <i>Bow</i>?&rsquo; Ah kind o&rsquo; went groggy after that, and
Ah have a sort o&rsquo; dim remembrance that some ane
flashit an &rsquo;lectric torch in ma face and said that Ah
must have been pitchit ower whan the <i>Bow</i> rammed
the <i>Seagull</i>, and that Ah prob&rsquo;ly hadna shaken doon
to ma new surroundin&rsquo;s. Ah tried hard to speir
what kind o&rsquo; a shakin&rsquo; doon they meant gin this
hadna been ane. But Ah didna seem to have the
power to mak&rsquo; ma words come straicht, and they
said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gane a bit off his chuck,&rsquo; and ca&rsquo;d some
ane to carry me below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pains runnin&rsquo; up and doon ma spine when
Ah was lowered doon the ladder were ower much
for me, and Ah passed off for a bit. Whan Ah cam
roun&rsquo; Ah was bein&rsquo; shoved along the ward-room
table&mdash;whaur Ah had been lyin&rsquo;&mdash;to mak&rsquo; room for<!-- Page 34 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a lad wi&rsquo; bandages roun&rsquo; his head and a&rsquo; drippin&rsquo;
wi&rsquo; salt water. His ship had gone doon twa hours
syne, and maist o&rsquo; the time he had been in the
water or roostin&rsquo; on a Carley Float. That lad&rsquo;s
name was Gains, noo the gun-layer o&rsquo; the fo&rsquo;most
gun o&rsquo; the <i>Spark</i>&mdash;him Ah saw ye talkin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; just
noo. He was strong and cheery himsel&rsquo;, but fower
o&rsquo; his mates were chilled to the bane, and Ah wacht
&rsquo;em shiver to death richt afore ma een.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was aboot daylicht when we pickit up a&rsquo;
that was left o&rsquo; the crew o&rsquo; the <i>Killarney</i>, and aboot
an hour efter we fell in wi&rsquo; the <i>Sportsman</i>, wha
passed us a hawser and tried to tow, stern-first,
what was left o&rsquo; the <i>Seagull</i>. Ah didna see what
was wrang, but they tellt me that the wreck o&rsquo;
the stern and the helm bein&rsquo; jammed hard
a-sta&rsquo;bo&rsquo;d made sae much drag that the cable partit.
Then there was naithing else to do&mdash;sin&rsquo; the <i>Seagull</i>
cudna steam&mdash;but to sink her wi&rsquo; gun-fire. The
captain askit permission for this by W.T., and
when it came they ditched the books and signals,
transferred abody to the <i>Sportsman</i>, and then gae
her a roun&rsquo; or twa at the water-line wi&rsquo; the <i>Sportsman&rsquo;s</i>
guns. Doon she gaed, and that,&rdquo; he concluded
with a grin, &ldquo;is the true yarn o&rsquo; the sinkin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; the <i>Seagull</i>. If only o&rsquo; ma mates try to mak&rsquo; ye
b&rsquo;lieve that she foundert &rsquo;count o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; hit and
holed by a &lsquo;human proj&rsquo; kent as Jock Campbell,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>&ldquo;FIREBRAND&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It was a little incident which occurred one night
when the Grand Fleet was returning to Base
from one of its periodical sweeps through the
North Sea that set Able-seaman Melton talking
of the things he had seen and felt and heard the
time he was standing anti-submarine watch in the
<i>Firebrand</i>, when her flotilla of destroyers mixed
itself up with a squadron of German cruisers in the
course of the &ldquo;dog-fight&rdquo; which concluded the battle
of Jutland.</p>

<p>I had found him, muffled to the eyes and dancing
a jangling jig on a sleet-slippery steel plate to keep
warm, when I picked my precarious way along the
coco-matted deck and climbed up to the after
searchlight platform of the Flotilla Leader I
chanced to be in at the time. A fairly decent day
was turning into a dirty night, and the steadily
thickening mistiness which accompanied a sodden
rain in process of transformation into soft snow
had reduced the visibility to a point where the
Commander-in-Chief deemed it safer for the Fleet
to put back to open sea and take no further chances<!-- Page 36 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
among the treacherous currents and rocky islands
that beset the approaches to the Northern Base.</p>

<p>The Flagship, which had received the order by
wireless, flashed &ldquo;Destroyers prepare to take station
for screening when Fleet alters to easterly
course at nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and shortly before that
hour the Flotilla Leader made the signal to execute.
Almost immediately I felt the hull of the <i>Flyer</i>
take on an accelerated throb as her speed was increased,
and a moment later the wake began to boil
higher as the helm was put hard-a-starboard to
bring her round. We were steaming a cable&rsquo;s length
on the starboard bow of the <i>Olympus</i>, the leading
ship of the squadron at the time, and the carrying
out of the man&oelig;uvre involved the <i>Flyer&rsquo;s</i> leading
her division across the head of the battleship line
and down the other side on an opposite course, so
that the destroyers would be in a position to resume
night-screening formation when the fleet had finished
turning.</p>

<p>Just how the captain of the <i>Flyer</i> happened to
cut his course so fine I never learned, but the
patchiness of the drifting mist must have had a
good deal to do with making him misjudge his distance.
At any rate, just as we had turned through
nine or ten points, I suddenly saw the ominously
bulking bows of the <i>Olympus</i> come juggernauting
out of the night, with the amorphous loom of the
bridge and foretop towering monstrously above.
The <i>Flyer</i> seemed fairly to jump out of the water<!-- Page 37 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
at the kick her propellers gave her as the turbines
responded to the bridge&rsquo;s call for &ldquo;More steam,&rdquo;
and a spinning puff of smoke darkened the glow
above the funnels for a moment as fresh oil was
sprayed upon the fires beneath the boilers.</p>

<p>It was a good deal like a cat scurrying in front
of a speeding motor-car, and the consequences
would have been more or less similar had not one of
the <i>Olympus&rsquo;s</i> swarming lookouts, peering into the
darkness from his screened nest, gathered hint of
the disaster that menaced in time to warn the forebridge.
The great super-dreadnought responded
to her helm very smartly considering her tonnage,
and she turned just far enough to starboard to
avoid grinding us under. I could almost look up
through the port hawse-pipe as the flare of her
bow loomed above my head, and the man standing
by the depth-charges on the all-but-grazed stern of
the <i>Flyer</i> might well have been pardoned even if
the story his mates afterwards told of his action
on this occasion were true&mdash;that he had tried to
fend off one of the largest battleships afloat with
a boat-hook.</p>

<p>A silhouette against the barely perceptible glow
at the back of the forebridge of a &ldquo;brass-hatted&rdquo;
officer shaking his fist as though in the act of ramping
and roaring like a true British sailor moved by
righteous anger; a forty or fifty degree heel to
starboard as the curling bow-wave of the <i>Olympus</i>
thwacked resoundingly along her port side, and<!-- Page 38 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the <i>Flyer</i> drove on into the sleet-shot darkness to
blow off accumulated steam in rolling clouds, allow
her fluttering pulse to become normal, and resume
the even tenor of her way.</p>

<p>Melton, A.B., whistling over and over the opening
bars of the chorus of &ldquo;Do You Want Us to
Lose the War?&rdquo; started his metallically clanking
jig again, but presently, like a man with something
on his mind, sidled over and shoved his Balaklava-bordered
face against the outside of the closely-reefed
hood of my &ldquo;lammy&rdquo; coat, and muttered
thickly something about being afraid he had got
himself into trouble. When I had pulled loose a
snap and improved communications by unmuffling
a lee ear, I learned that it had just occurred to the
good chap that he failed to report to the bridge
the battleship he had sighted &ldquo;fifty yards to the
port beam,&rdquo; and he was wondering whether there
would be a &ldquo;strafe&rdquo; coming from the skipper
about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact is, sir,&rdquo; he said, speaking brokenly as the
galloping gusts every now and then forced a word
back into his mouth, &ldquo;that that rip-rarin&rsquo; stem,
with the white foam flyin&rsquo; off both sides of it, bearing
down right for where I was standin&rsquo;&mdash;all that
was so like what I saw the night of Jutland in the
<i>Firebrand</i> that&mdash;that the turn it give me took my
mind right back and&mdash;and I wasn&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
anything else till the <i>&rsquo;Lympus</i> was gone by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assured him that, since the <i>Olympus</i> had doubtless<!-- Page 39 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
been sighted from the bridge several winks
before she had been visible from his less-favourable
vantage, they would probably have been too busy
to respond to his call at the voice-pipe even had he
tried to report what he saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I would forget all
about that, and try to explain how a cruiser that
the <i>Firebrand</i> was about to ram bow-to-bow&rdquo; (I
had, of course, already heard something of that
dare-devilish exploit) &ldquo;could have looked to you
like the <i>Olympus</i> ramping down on a right-angling
course and threatening to slice off the <i>Flyer&rsquo;s</i> stern
with all her depth-charges. I quite understood that
one ramming is a good deal like another, as far as
a big ship hitting a destroyer fair and square is
concerned, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t that <i>first</i> cru&rsquo;ser &rsquo;tall, sir,&rdquo; Melton interrupted,
nuzzling into my &ldquo;lammy&rdquo; hood again
to make himself heard. &ldquo;Twas &rsquo;nother &rsquo;un, sir&mdash;a
wallopin&rsquo; big un. The seas was stiff wi&rsquo; cru&rsquo;sers fer
a minit, sir, an&rsquo; no sooner was we clear o&rsquo; the first
un than the second come tearin&rsquo; down on us, tryin&rsquo;
to cut us in two amidships. An&rsquo; that last un was a
battl&rsquo; cru&rsquo;ser nigh as big as the <i>&rsquo;Lympus</i>, all shot
up in the funnels and runnin&rsquo; wild an&rsquo; bloody-minded
like a mad bull. We were pretty nigh to
bein&rsquo; stopped dead, an&rsquo; if she hadn&rsquo;t been slower&rsquo;n
cold grease wi&rsquo; her helm she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; eat us right up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been nothing of malice aforethought
in my action in cornering Melton on the searchlight<!-- Page 40 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
platform that night, for, as it chanced, I had
failed to learn up to that moment that he had been
in the famous <i>Firebrand</i> at Jutland. Nor, with the
wind and sea getting up as fast as the glass and
the thermometer were going down, was the time or
the place quite what a man would have chosen for
anything in the way of cosy fireside reminiscence.
But, both these facts notwithstanding, I felt that,
since I was leaving the <i>Flyer</i> to go to another base
directly she arrived in harbour on the morrow, it
would be criminal to neglect the opportunity of
hearing what was perhaps the most sportingly
spectacular of all the Jutland destroyer actions
related by one who was actually in it. I did not
dare to distract Melton&rsquo;s attention from his lookout
by drawing him into talking while he was still
on watch, but, when he was relieved at ten o&rsquo;clock,
I waylaid him at the foot of the ladder with a pot
of steaming hot ship&rsquo;s cocoa (foraged from the
galley by a sympathetic ward-room steward) and
both pockets of my &ldquo;lammy&rdquo; coat filled with the
remnants of a box of assorted Yankee &ldquo;candy&rdquo;
looted from the American submarine in which I
had been on patrol the week before.</p>

<p>Melton rose to the lure instantly&mdash;or perhaps
I should say &ldquo;fell to the bribe&rdquo;&mdash;for the British
bluejacket, if only he were given a chance to develop,
is quite as sweet of tooth as his brother
Yank. Because I could hardly take him to the
captain&rsquo;s cabin, which I was occupying for the<!-- Page 41 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
moment, for a yarn, and because he, likewise,
could not take me down to the mess deck to disturb
the off-watch sleepers with our chatter, there was
nothing to do but carry on as best we could in the
friendly lee of one of the funnels.</p>

<p>It was a night of infernal inkiness by now, and
only clinging patches of soft snow and their
blanker blankness revealed the dimly guessable
lines of whaler and cowls and torpedo tubes and the
loom of the loftier bridge. The battleship line was
masked completely by the double curtain of the
darkness and the snow, and only a tremulous greyness,
barely discernible in the intervals of the
flurries of flakes where the starboard bow-wave
curled back from the <i>Olympus</i>, gave an intermittent
bearing to help in keeping station. Underfoot
was the blackness of the pit, not the faintest gleam
reflecting from the waves washing over the weather
side to swirl half-knee high about our sea boots.
Even overhead all that was visible were fluttering
patches of snow flakes dancing through the haloes of
pale rose radiance that crowned the tops of the funnels.
The wail of the wind in the wireless aerials,
the crash of the surging beam seas, the throb of the
propellers, and the pussy-cat purr of the spinning
turbines&mdash;these were the fit accompaniment to
which Melton A.B. recited to me the epic of the
<i>Firebrand</i> at Jutland.</p>

<p>The cocoa I quaffed mug for mug with Melton,
down to the last of the sweet, sustaining &ldquo;settlings&rdquo;<!-- Page 42 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in the bottom of the pot; but the candy I
kept in reserve to draw on from time to time as it
was needed to lubricate his tongue and stoke the
smouldering fires of his memory. I started him off
with a red-and-white &ldquo;barber&rsquo;s pole&rdquo; stick, which
took not a little fumbling with mittened hands to
extract from its greased tissue paper wrapper, and
the seductive fragrance of crunched peppermint
mingled with the acrid fumes of burning petroleum
as he leaned close and began to tell how the &mdash;&mdash;th
Flotilla, to which the <i>Firebrand</i> belonged, screening
the &mdash;&mdash;th B.S. of the Battle Fleet, came upon
the scene toward the end of the long summer afternoon.
He had witnessed Beatty&rsquo;s consummate
man&oelig;uvre of &ldquo;crossing the T&rdquo; of the enemy line
with the four that remained of his battered First
Battle Cruiser Squadron, and he had seen the main
Battle Fleet baulked of its action the lowering
mists and the closing in of darkness; but it was not
until full night had clapped down its lid that the
fun for the <i>Firebrand</i> really began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just &rsquo;twixt daylight an&rsquo; dark,&rdquo; he said,
reaching me a steadying hand in the darkness as
the <i>Flyer</i> teetered giddily down the back of a receding
sea, &ldquo;that the flotilla dropped back to take
stashun &rsquo;stern the battl&rsquo;ships we was screenin&rsquo;. The
<i>Killarney</i> was leadin&rsquo; an&rsquo; after her came the <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i>,
<i>Seagull</i>, <i>Wreath</i>, an&rsquo; <i>Consort</i>, makin&rsquo; up the
First Divishun. <i>Wreath</i> an&rsquo; <i>Consort</i> sighted some
Hun U-boats and &rsquo;stroyers while this move was on,<!-- Page 43 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
an&rsquo; plunk&rsquo;d off a few shots at &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t think wi&rsquo;
any fatal consequence. Then there come the rattle
of light gun fire from the south&rsquo;ard, like from
cru&rsquo;sers or battleships repellin&rsquo; T.B.D.&rsquo;s. Then it
was all serene for mor&rsquo;n an &rsquo;our, an&rsquo; then all hell
opens up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suspected, from the sounds he made, that Melton
had bitten into a block of milk chocolate
without removing its wrapping of foil and paper,
but presently his enunciation grew less explosive
and more intelligible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Hun cru&rsquo;sers drivin&rsquo; down on us from
the starboard quarter that started the monkey-show,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that bein&rsquo; the nor&rsquo;west it was
hardly where we&rsquo;d reason to expect &rsquo;em from. It
looks like we had &rsquo;em clean cut off, wi&rsquo; the &rsquo;hole
Battl&rsquo; Fleet steamin&rsquo; &rsquo;tween &rsquo;em an&rsquo; their way back
home, an&rsquo; that they was tryin&rsquo; to sneak through in
the darkness. The <i>Wreath</i>, at the end o&rsquo; the line
nearest &rsquo;em, spotted &rsquo;em first, and she, &rsquo;cause she
didn&rsquo;t want to give herself &rsquo;way wi&rsquo; flashin&rsquo;, reported
what she&rsquo;d seen by low-power W.T. to the
rest o&rsquo; the flotilla. Course I&mdash;standin&rsquo; watch aft&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
know nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout that signal, so that the
first I hears o&rsquo; the Huns was when they all opened
up on the poor ol&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i>, &rsquo;cause she was the
leader. I s&rsquo;pose, and she started firin&rsquo; back at
their flashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The leadin&rsquo; Hun flashed his searchlight on the
<i>Killarney</i> as he opened up, but shut off sharp when<!-- Page 44 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<i>Killarney</i> came back at him. I could see some o&rsquo;
the projes flittin&rsquo; right down the light beam until
it blinked off, an&rsquo; it was a flock of two or three of
these that I kept my eye on all the way till they
bashed into the <i>Killarney&rsquo;s</i> bridge and busted.
She was zigzaggin&rsquo; a coupl&rsquo; o&rsquo; points on <i>Firebrand&rsquo;s</i>
starboard bow just then, so my standin&rsquo; aft didn&rsquo;t
prevent my gettin&rsquo; a good look at what was happenin&rsquo;.
I could see the bodies o&rsquo; four or five men
flyin&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; the wreckage o&rsquo; the explosion, an&rsquo; then,
all in a minnit, she was rollin&rsquo; in flames from the
funnels right for&rsquo;ard. By the light o&rsquo; it I could see
the crews o&rsquo; the &rsquo;midships and after guns workin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em like devils, an&rsquo; twice anyhow, an&rsquo; I think three
times, I saw a bright, shiny slug slip over the side,
an&rsquo; knew they were loosin&rsquo; mouldies to try to get
their own back from the Hun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sea was boilin&rsquo; up red as blood where the
light from the burnin&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i> fell on the spouts
the Huns&rsquo; projes was throwin&rsquo; up all round her.
She was the fairest mark ever a gun trained on,
and p&rsquo;raps that was what tempted the Hun to keep
pumpin&rsquo; projes at her instead o&rsquo; givin&rsquo; more attenshun
to the rest of the divishun trailin&rsquo; astern.
That was what gave <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> her first chance o&rsquo;
alterin&rsquo; the Hun navy list that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second cru&rsquo;ser in the Hun line was bearin&rsquo;
right abeam to starboard by now, an&rsquo; I could see by
her gun-flashes she was of good size, wi&rsquo; four long
funnels fillin&rsquo; up all the deck &rsquo;tween her two masts.<!-- Page 45 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
She was firing fast in salvoes wi&rsquo; all the guns that
would bear on the burnin&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i>. I could just
make out by the light from the <i>Killarney</i>, which
was growin&rsquo; stronger every minnit, that the crew of
our after torpedo tube was gettin&rsquo; busy, an&rsquo; while I
was watchin&rsquo; &rsquo;em, over flops the mouldie and starts
to run. I knew it was aimed for one or t&rsquo;other o&rsquo;
the two leadin&rsquo; Huns, but wasn&rsquo;t dead sure which
till I saw the after funnels an&rsquo; mainmast o&rsquo; the
second toppl&rsquo; over an&rsquo; a big flash o&rsquo; fire take their
place. Then it looked like there was exploshuns
right off fore an&rsquo; aft, and then fires broke out all
over her from stem to stern. Next thing I knows,
she takes a big list to starboard, an&rsquo; over she goes,
wi&rsquo; more exploshuns throwin&rsquo; up spouts o&rsquo; steam, as
she rolls under. The second mouldie&mdash;it got away
right after the first&mdash;was never needed to finish
the job. The <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> had evened up the score for
the <i>Killarney</i>, wi&rsquo; a good margin over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain turned away to reload mouldies
after that, an&rsquo; just as we swung out o&rsquo; line I saw a
salvo straddle the <i>Killarney</i>, and two or three
shells hit square &rsquo;tween her funnels an&rsquo; after
sup&rsquo;rstruct&rsquo;r&rsquo;. They must have gone off in her engine
room, for there was more steam than fire risin&rsquo;
from her as we turned an&rsquo; left her astern, an&rsquo; she
looked stopped dead. A Hun cru&rsquo;ser was closin&rsquo;
the blazin&rsquo; wreck o&rsquo; her, firm&rsquo; hard; but, by Gawd,
what d&rsquo;you think I saw. The only patch on the
ol&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i> that was free o&rsquo; the ragin&rsquo; fires was<!-- Page 46 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
her stern, an&rsquo; from there the steady flashes of her
after gun showed it was bein&rsquo; worked as fast an&rsquo;
reg&rsquo;lar as ever I seen it done at any night-firin&rsquo;
practice. I looked to see her blow up every minnit,
but she was still spittin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; that littl&rsquo; after gun
when the sudden flashin&rsquo; up of the fightin&rsquo; lights
for&rsquo;ard turned my attenshun nearer home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could just make out a line of what looked like
&rsquo;stroyers headin&rsquo; cross our bows, an&rsquo; thought we&rsquo;d
stumbled into &rsquo;nother nest o&rsquo; Huns till they answered
back wi&rsquo; the signal o&rsquo; the day, an&rsquo; I knew
it was one of our own flotillas we&rsquo;d been catchin&rsquo;
up to. That flashin&rsquo; up o&rsquo; lights come near to doin&rsquo;
for us tho&rsquo;, for it showed us up to a big Hun
steamin&rsquo; three or four miles off on the port beam,
an&rsquo; he claps a searchlight on us an&rsquo; chases it up wi&rsquo;
a sheaf o&rsquo; shells. The only proj that hit us bounced
off wi&rsquo;out doin&rsquo; much hurt to the ship, but some
flyin&rsquo; hunks o&rsquo; it smashed the mouldie davit and
knocked out most o&rsquo; the crews o&rsquo; the after tubes,
includin&rsquo; the T.G.M.<span class="fnanchor"> <a name="footnotec" id="footnotec"></a><a href="#footc">[C]</a></span> That put a stop to reloadin&rsquo;
operashuns wi&rsquo; a mouldie in only one o&rsquo; the tubes.
By good luck we managed to zigzag out o&rsquo; the
searchlight beam right after that, an&rsquo; was free to
turn back an&rsquo; try to start a divershun for the poor
ol&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i>.</p>
<div class="footnote"><a name="footc" id="footc"></a>
<a href="#footnotec">[C]</a> Torpedo Gunner&rsquo;s Mate.
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Her fires looked to be dyin&rsquo; down when we first
picked her up, but right after that some more projes
bust on her an&rsquo; she started blazin&rsquo; harder than
<!-- Page 47 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
ever. I watched for the spittin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that littl&rsquo; after
gun, but when it come it looked to spurt right out
o&rsquo; the heart o&rsquo; a blazin&rsquo; furnace, showin&rsquo; the fire was
now burnin&rsquo; from stem to stern. One more salvo
plastered over her, an&rsquo; that one got no reply. The
good ol&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Killy</i>&rsquo; had shot her bolt, an&rsquo; her finish
looked a matter o&rsquo; minnits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was plain enough if anyone was still livin&rsquo;
they was goin&rsquo; to need pickin&rsquo; up in a hurry, an&rsquo;
the captain put the <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> at full speed to close
her an&rsquo; stan&rsquo; by to give a han&rsquo;. Just then I saw a
Hun searchlight turned on and start feelin&rsquo; its
way up to where the <i>Killarney</i> was burning, wi&rsquo;
a cru&rsquo;ser followin&rsquo; up the small end o&rsquo; the beam,
seemin&rsquo; to be nosin&rsquo; in to end the mis&rsquo;ry. She did
not bear right for a mouldie, but we opened up wi&rsquo;
the foremost gun, an&rsquo; I saw the shells bustin&rsquo; on
her bridge and fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; like rotten apples chucked
&rsquo;against a wall. The light blinked off as the first
proj hit home, but there was no way to tell if it
was shot away or no. It was the second time that
night that we&rsquo;d done our bit to ease off the hell
turned loose on the <i>Killarney</i>. Likewise it was the
last. From then on we had our own partic&rsquo;lar hell
to wriggle out of, wi&rsquo; no time left to play &lsquo;Venging
Nemisus&rsquo; to our stricken sisters. Just a big bonfire
sittin&rsquo; on the sea an&rsquo; lickin&rsquo; a hole in the night
wi&rsquo; its flames&mdash;that was the last I saw of the ol&rsquo;
<i>Killarney</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Melton paused for a moment as if engrossed in<!-- Page 48 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the memories conjured up by his narrative, and I
took advantage of the interval to hand him one of
those most loved lollipops of Yankee youngster-hood,
a plump, hard ball of toothsome saccharinity
called&mdash;obviously from its resistant resiliency&mdash;an
&ldquo;All-Day Sucker.&rdquo; When he spoke again I knew
in an instant that a sure instinct had led him to
make the proper disposition of the succulent dainty&mdash;that
it was stowed snugly away in a bulging
cheek like a squirrel&rsquo;s nut, to melt away in its own
good time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tween the glare of the burnin&rsquo; <i>Killarney</i>,&rdquo; Melton
went on after thrashing his hands across his
shoulders for a minute to warm them up, &ldquo;the
gleam o&rsquo; the Hun cru&rsquo;ser&rsquo;s searchlight an&rsquo; the flash
o&rsquo; our own gun-fire, we must all have been more or
less blinded in the <i>Firebrand</i>, for we had run close
to what may have been a part of the main en&rsquo;my
battl&rsquo; line wi&rsquo;out nothin&rsquo; bein&rsquo; reported. Our firin&rsquo;
had give us away, o&rsquo; course, an&rsquo; the nearest ships
must have had their guns trained on us, waitin&rsquo; to
be sure what we was. One o&rsquo; &rsquo;em must have made
up his mind we was en&rsquo;my even before we spotted
&rsquo;em at all, for the first thing I saw was the white
o&rsquo; the bow wave an&rsquo; wake as she turned toward us,
prob&rsquo;ly to ram. She&rsquo;d have caught us just about
midships if the bridge hadn&rsquo;t sighted her an&rsquo; done
the only thing open to do&mdash;turned to meet her
head on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that either she or us switched<!-- Page 49 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
on recognition lights, but the Hun opened with
ev&rsquo;rything that would bear just before we slammed
together. It must have been by the gun-flashes
that I saw she had three funnels, wi&rsquo; what
looked like some kind o&rsquo; marks painted on &rsquo;em in
red. I saw our second funnel give a jump and
crumple up as a proj hit it, an&rsquo; then a spurt o&rsquo;
flame&mdash;from a big gun fired almost point-blank&mdash;looked
to shoot right on to the bridge. I thought
that it must have killed ev&rsquo;ry man there an&rsquo; carried
away all the steering gear. But no.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old <i>Firebrand</i> wi&rsquo; helm hard-a-port, went
swingin&rsquo; right on thro&rsquo; the point or two more that
saved her life. I could feel by the way she jumped
an&rsquo; gathered herself that last second that the ol&rsquo;
girl was still under control. Then we struck wi&rsquo;
a horrible grind an&rsquo; crash, an&rsquo; I went sprawlin&rsquo;
flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Hun had hit us half a wink sooner, or if
we had turned half a point less, we&rsquo;d have been
swallowed alive and split up in small hunks. As
it was, we didn&rsquo;t have a lot the worst o&rsquo; it, an&rsquo;
p&rsquo;raps we more than broke even. It was like a
mastiff an&rsquo; terrier runnin&rsquo; into each other in the
dark, an&rsquo; the terrier only gettin&rsquo; run over an&rsquo; the
mastiff gettin&rsquo; a piece bit clean out o&rsquo; his neck. It
was our port bows that come together, an&rsquo; for only
a sort o&rsquo; glancin&rsquo; blow. But it was the stem o&rsquo; the
<i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> that was turned in sharpest, an&rsquo; it was<!-- Page 50 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
her that was hittin&rsquo; up&mdash;by a good ten knots&mdash;the
most speed. She was left in a terribl&rsquo; mess, but
most o&rsquo; the damage was from her rammin&rsquo; the Hun,
not from the Hun rammin&rsquo; her. While as for what
she did to the Hun, the best proof o&rsquo; it was the
more&rsquo;n twenty feet of her side-platin&rsquo;&mdash;an upper
strake, wi&rsquo; scuttl&rsquo; holes in it an&rsquo; pieces o&rsquo; gutterway
deck hangin&rsquo; to it&mdash;that we found in the wreck of
our fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;. If the hole that hunk of steel left behind
it didn&rsquo;t put that Hun out o&rsquo; bus&rsquo;ness as a
fightin&rsquo; unit till she got back to port an&rsquo; had a
refit, I&rsquo;ll eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite clear in my mind whether Melton
meant to imply that he would eat the hole in the
Hun cruiser or the hunk of steel that came out of it,
but there <i>was</i> no room for doubt that the violent
crunch with which he emphasised the assertion had
put a period to the life of his &ldquo;All-Day Sucker,&rdquo;
which was never intended to be treated like chewing
toffy. Dipping into the grab-bag of my &ldquo;lammy&rdquo;
coat pocket for something with which to replace it,
therefore, I brought up a stick of chewing gum, and
he resumed his story in an atmosphere sweet with
the ineffable odour of spearmint and escaping
steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much the Hun was shook up by that
smash,&rdquo; Melton continued, &ldquo;you can reckon from
this: We was almost dead stopped for some
minnits, an&rsquo; all out o&rsquo; control from the time of
rammin&rsquo; till they started connin&rsquo; her from the<!-- Page 51 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
engine-room. There was one fire flickerin&rsquo; in the
wreckage o&rsquo; the forebridge, an&rsquo; another somewhere
&rsquo;midships, while there was also a big glare throwin&rsquo;
up where the foremost funnel was shot away. We
was as soft an&rsquo; easy a target as even a Hun could
ask for; an&rsquo; yet that one was in too much of a funk
wi&rsquo; his own hurts to let off a singl&rsquo; other gun at us
in all the time that he must have been flounderin&rsquo;
on at not much more&rsquo;n point-blank range. Mebbe
he was knocked up even more&rsquo;n we thought.
Nothin&rsquo; else would account for him not havin&rsquo;
&rsquo;nother go at us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one wild bally mess&mdash;that was what the
<i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> looked like when I got to my feet again
an&rsquo; cast an eye for&rsquo;ard. There was too much
smoke an&rsquo; steam to see clear, an&rsquo; it was mostly
flickers o&rsquo; red light where the fires were startin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; big, black shadows full o&rsquo; wreckage. As it
looked to <i>me</i> from aft&mdash;tho&rsquo;, o&rsquo; course, the full
effects wasn&rsquo;t vis&rsquo;bl&rsquo; till daylight, the bridge an&rsquo;
searchlight platform an&rsquo; mast was shoved right
back an&rsquo; piled up on the foremost funnel. The
whaler an&rsquo; dingy was carried away, an&rsquo; my first
thought, for I was sure she was sinkin&rsquo;, was that
we had no boats to put off in. I could see two or
three wounded crawlin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the raffle, but I knew
that the most to be dished would be in the wreck
o&rsquo; the bridge. The queerest thing o&rsquo; all was the
flashes o&rsquo; green an&rsquo; blue light flutterin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; the
tangled steel o&rsquo; the wreckage. At first I thought<!-- Page 52 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I was sort o' seein' things; but fin'lly I figgered it
out as the juice from the busted 'lectric wires short-circuitin'.
It meant, I tol' myself, that the men
under them tons o' steel was bein' 'lectrocuted on
top o' bein' crushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looked like any one o' three or four things
would be enough to finish the ol' <i>Firebran'</i>. I remember
thinkin' that if she didn't blow up, she was
sure to burn up; an' that if, by chance, she
missed doin' one o' them, she was goin' to founder
anyhow. She was already well down by the head,
an&rsquo;&mdash;leastways, it looked so to me at the time&mdash;still
settlin&rsquo; fast. An&rsquo; I was just reflectin&rsquo; that, even if
she was lucky enough not to burn up, or blow up,
or founder, she was still too easy pickin&rsquo; for the
Huns to miss doin&rsquo; her in one way or &rsquo;nother, when,
thunderin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the darkness an&rsquo; headin&rsquo; up to
crumpl&rsquo; underfoot what was left o&rsquo; the stopped an&rsquo;
helpless <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i>, come a hulkin&rsquo; big battl&rsquo; cru&rsquo;ser,
the one I was just tellin&rsquo; you the <i>&rsquo;Lympus</i> set me
thinkin&rsquo; on a while back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starin&rsquo; at our own fires must have blinded me a
good bit, or I&rsquo;d have seen him sooner&rsquo;n I did. He
looked like he been gettin&rsquo; no end o&rsquo; a hammerin&rsquo;,
for his second funnel was gone, an&rsquo; out of the hole
it left a big spurt o&rsquo; flame an&rsquo; smoke was rushin&rsquo;
that would have showed him up for miles. There
was a red hot fire ragin&rsquo; under his fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;, too, an&rsquo;
I saw the flames lashin&rsquo; round thro&rsquo; some jagged
shell holes in his port bow. Lucky for us, he was<!-- Page 53 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
runnin&rsquo; for his life, an&rsquo; had no time to more than
try to run us down in passin&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been just from habit I yelled
down my voice-pipe, for I knew they was no longer
controllin&rsquo; her from the bridge; but the roarin&rsquo; o&rsquo;
a fire an&rsquo; the clank of bangin&rsquo; metal was the only
sounds that come back. When I looked up again
the Hun was right on top of us, an&rsquo; I must have
just stood there&mdash;froze&mdash;like to-night wi&rsquo; the
<i>&rsquo;Lympus</i>. By the grace o&rsquo; Gawd, he hadn&rsquo;t been
abl&rsquo; to alter course enough to do the trick. His
stem shot by wi&rsquo; twenty feet or more clearance, an&rsquo;
it was only the fat bulge of him that kissed us off
in passin&rsquo;. It was by the glare o&rsquo; his fires, not ours,
which throwed no light abaft the superstructure
I was on, that I saw some of the hands was already
workin&rsquo; to rig a jury steerin&rsquo; gear aft. Then he was
gone, an&rsquo; much too full o&rsquo; his own troubles to turn
back, or even send the one heavy proj that would
have cooked us for good an&rsquo; all. A few minutes
more, an&rsquo; the wreck o&rsquo; the <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> begun gatherin&rsquo;
way again, an&rsquo; when I saw her come round to her
nor&rsquo;westerly course an&rsquo; push ahead wi&rsquo;out settlin&rsquo;
any deeper, I knew that the bulkheads were holdin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; that&mdash;always providin&rsquo; we run into no more
Huns&mdash;there was a fightin&rsquo; chance o&rsquo; pullin&rsquo; thro&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was about a hundred jobs that needed
doin&rsquo; all at once, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tween the loss o&rsquo; dead an&rsquo;
wounded&mdash;only about half the reg&rsquo;lar ship&rsquo;s company
was fit for work. The bulkheads had to be<!-- Page 54 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
shored, for, wi&rsquo; the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; crumpled up like a concertina
an&rsquo; the deck an&rsquo; side platin&rsquo; ripped off from
the stem right back to the capstan engine, she was
open to the whole North Sea from the galley right
for&rsquo;ard. This made the first an&rsquo; second bulkheads
o&rsquo; no use, an&rsquo; made the third bulkhead all that stood
&rsquo;tween us an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to the bottom. Then there was
the fires&mdash;&rsquo;bove deck an&rsquo; &rsquo;tween decks&mdash;that had to
be put out &rsquo;fore they got to the magazines, an&rsquo; the
engines to be kept goin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the ship to be navigated,
an&rsquo; the wounded to be looked to. An&rsquo; on top
o&rsquo; all this, the ship had to be got into some kind o&rsquo;
fightin&rsquo; trim in case any more Huns come pokin&rsquo;
her way. I won&rsquo;t be havin&rsquo; to tell you it was one
bally awful job, carryin&rsquo; on like that in the dark,
an&rsquo; wi&rsquo; half the ship&rsquo;s company knocked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I saw it was the first lieutenant that
seemed to be directin&rsquo; things, I took it the captain
was done for, an&rsquo; that was what everyone thought
till, all o&rsquo; a sudden, he come wrigglin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the
wreck o&rsquo; the bridge&mdash;all messed up an&rsquo; covered wi&rsquo;
blood, but not much hurt otherways&mdash;an&rsquo; began
carryin&rsquo; on just as if it was &lsquo;Gen&rsquo;ral Quarters.&rsquo;
Some cove wi&rsquo; the stump o&rsquo; his hand tied up wi&rsquo;
First Aid dressin&rsquo; was sent up to relieve me on the
lookout, an&rsquo; I was put to fightin&rsquo; fires an&rsquo; clearin&rsquo;
up the wreck &rsquo;bove decks. As there ain&rsquo;t much to
burn on a &rsquo;stroyer if the cordite ain&rsquo;t started, we
were not long gettin&rsquo; the fires in hand, even wi&rsquo;
havin&rsquo;&mdash;cause the hoses an&rsquo; the fire-mains was<!-- Page 55 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
knocked out&mdash;to dip up water in buckets throwed
over the side. Wi&rsquo; the wreckage, the most we could
do was to dig out the dead an&rsquo; wounded an&rsquo; rig up
for connin&rsquo; ship from aft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a nasty job when we started in on the
wreck o&rsquo; the forebridge, for the witch-lights o&rsquo; the
short-circuit were still dancin&rsquo; a cancan in the
smashed an&rsquo; twisted steel plates an&rsquo; girders, an&rsquo; it
kept a cove lookin&rsquo; lively to keep from switchin&rsquo;
some of the blue-green lightnin&rsquo; into his own frame
by way o&rsquo; his ax or saw. No one that had been on
any part o&rsquo; the bridge was wi&rsquo;out some kind o&rsquo; hurt,
but the three dead was a deal less than was to be
expected. There was also three very bad knocked
up, an&rsquo; on one o&rsquo; them the surgeon&mdash;a young probasuner
R.N.V.R.&mdash;performed an operashun in the
dark. It was a cove he was &rsquo;fraid to move wi&rsquo;out
tinkerin&rsquo; up a bit, an&rsquo; he pulled him thro&rsquo; all right
in the end. One o&rsquo; the crew of the foremost gun
never turned up, an&rsquo; we figured he must have been
lost overboard when she rammed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pois&rsquo;nous as it was workin&rsquo; on deck, that wasn&rsquo;t
a circumstance to what it must have been carryin&rsquo;
on below. I didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that end o&rsquo; the
show, thank Gawd, but every man as came out o&rsquo; it
alive said it was just one livin&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; hell, no
less. There was a good number o&rsquo; coves who did
things off han&rsquo; that saved the ship from blowin&rsquo; up,
or burnin&rsquo; up, or sinkin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; three o&rsquo; the best o&rsquo;
&rsquo;em was a engine-room artif&rsquo;cer, a stoker P.O., and a<!-- Page 56 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
stoker that was in the fore stokehold when the
bridge was pushed back an&rsquo; carried away that funnel.
They ducked into their resp&rsquo;rators, stuck to
their posts a&rsquo; kept the fans goin&rsquo; till the fumes was
all cleared away. Nothin&rsquo; else would have saved
the foremost boiler&mdash;an&rsquo; wi&rsquo; it the ship herself&mdash;blowin&rsquo;
up right then an&rsquo; there. Same way, gettin&rsquo;
on the jump in backin&rsquo; up Number 3 bulkhead&mdash;the
one that was holding back the whole North Sea&mdash;was
all that kept it from bulgin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; floodin&rsquo;
right back into the stokeholds. It was the chief
art&rsquo;ficer engineer that took on that job, an&rsquo; it was
him, too, that stopped up the gaps left by the knocking
down o&rsquo; the first and second funnels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even after it at last seemed like we was goin&rsquo;
to keep her from sinkin&rsquo; or blowin&rsquo; up, things still
looked so bad to the captain that he ditched the box
o&rsquo; secret books for fear o&rsquo; their fallin&rsquo; into the hands
o&rsquo; the Hun. As we&rsquo;d have been more hindrance
than help to the Fleet, he did not try to rejoin the
flotilla, but turned west an&rsquo; headed for the coast o&rsquo;
England on the chance of makin&rsquo; the nearest base
while she still hung together. All night she went
slap-bangin&rsquo; along, wi&rsquo; the engines shakin&rsquo; out a few
more rev&rsquo;lushuns just as fast as it seemed the bulkhead
was shored strong enough to stand the push
o&rsquo; the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; found her still goin&rsquo;, but what a sight
she was! My first good look at what was left o&rsquo;
her give me the same kind o&rsquo; a shock I got the first<!-- Page 57 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
time I had a peep at my mug in a glass after havin&rsquo;
small-pox in Singapore. She wasn&rsquo;t a ship at all,
any more&rsquo;n my face was a face. She was just a
mess, that&rsquo;s all, an&rsquo; clinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; clankin&rsquo; an&rsquo; wheezin&rsquo;
and sneezin&rsquo; an&rsquo; yawin&rsquo; all over the sea. An&rsquo; the
sea was empty all the way roun&rsquo;, wi&rsquo; no ship in sight
to pass us a tow-line or pick us up if she chucked
in her hand an&rsquo; went down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had our hands so full keepin&rsquo; her afloat an&rsquo;
under weigh, that it wasn&rsquo;t till four in the afternoon&mdash;more&rsquo;n
sixteen hours after we rammed the
Hun cru&rsquo;ser&mdash;that we found time to bury our dead.
It was like gettin&rsquo; a turribl&rsquo; load off your chest
when we dropped &rsquo;em over in their hammocks wi&rsquo;
a fire-bar stitched in alongside &rsquo;em to take &rsquo;em
down. Nothin&rsquo; is so depressin&rsquo; to a sailor as bein&rsquo;
shipmates wi&rsquo; a mate that ain&rsquo;t a mate no longer.
Even the ol&rsquo; <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i> &rsquo;peared to ride easier an&rsquo;
more b&rsquo;oyant after the buryin&rsquo; was over, as if she
knowed the worst o&rsquo; her sorrer was left behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck took a turn against us again just after
dark, for the wind shifted six or seven points an&rsquo;
started blowin&rsquo; strong from dead ahead. We had
to alter course some to ease off the bang o&rsquo; the seas
a bit, an&rsquo; fin&rsquo;ly the speed had to be slowed even
slower&rsquo;n before to keep the bulkhead from being
driv&rsquo; in. But she weathered it, by Gawd she did,
an&rsquo; next mornin&rsquo; the goin&rsquo; was easier. We made
the Tyne at noon. It was just a heap o&rsquo; ol&rsquo; scrap-iron
so far as the eye could see, that they let into<!-- Page 58 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the Middle Dock the next day, but it was scrap-iron
that had come all the way from Jutland under
its own steam, an&rsquo; wi&rsquo; no help from no one save what
was left o&rsquo; the lads as once manned a &rsquo;stroyer called
the <i>Firebran&rsquo;</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hadn&rsquo;t taken long to reduce her from a
&rsquo;stroyer to scrap-iron, an&rsquo; it didn&rsquo;t seem like it took
much longer&mdash;time goes fast on home leave&mdash;to
turn that scrap-iron back into a &rsquo;stroyer again. The
ol&rsquo; <i>Firebran&rsquo;s</i> got many a good kick in her yet, so
they say, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ask for nothin&rsquo; better&rsquo;n to be
finishin&rsquo; the war in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked Melton for his yarn, bade him good
night, and was about to start picking my way to
my cabin to turn in, when I sensed rather than saw
that there was something further he wanted to say,
perhaps some final tribute to his officers and mates
of the <i>Firebrand</i>, I thought. There was a shuffling
of sea-booted feet on the steel deck, a nervous pulling
off and on of woollen mittens, and it was out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to say, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
likes the Yankee Jackies very much; &rsquo;specially
their candy an&rsquo; chewin&rsquo; gum. I was just wonderin&rsquo;
if that last stick you give me was all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I emptied both pockets before I renewed my
thanks to Melton and bade him a final good night.
There are strange ingredients entering into the
composition of the cement that is binding Britain
and America together, and if there is any objection
to chewing gum it certainly cannot be on the
ground that it lacks adhesiveness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>&ldquo;BACK FROM THE JAWS&rdquo;</h3>


<p>I had gone to the <i>Nairobi</i>, not because the
rather routine stunt her flotilla was on promised
any excitement, but rather because of the
notable part she had played in the Jutland action
and the fact that I had been assured that there was
still in her an officer who was said to have figured
prominently in the splendid account she had given
of herself on that occasion. As luck would have it,
however, this officer had been appointed to another
destroyer only a day or two previously, so that no
veteran of the great action remained in the ward
room. A canvass of the ship&rsquo;s company revealed
that one of the stoker petty officers was a Jutland
survivor, but before I could run him to cover some
kind of a light cruiser affair had occurred down
Heligoland Bight way which called for destroyer
work in that direction, and the next two days, with
the flotilla creasing up the brine at high speed and
everyone at Action Stations most of the time, were
not favourable for the &ldquo;intimate reminiscence&rdquo; I
was bent on drawing out.</p>

<p>It was not until the flotilla, salt-frosted and low
in fuel, was lounging along in the leisurely dalliance<!-- Page 60 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of half-speed on the way back to base that I cornered
Stoker Petty Officer Prince in the angle between
the foremost torpedo tubes and the starboard
rail, and engaged him in serious discussion of the
shamefulness of supplying worn-out films to the
Dep&ocirc;t Ship kinema. The second dog watch was
only half gone, but in the hour that elapsed before
it was over there was no mention of Jutland, or
anything else connected with the war for that matter,
though the talk ran the full gamut from cabbages
to kings. I mean this quite literally, for he
began by telling me of what his mother had raised
in her allotment at Ipswich, and was describing
how, when he was on a cruise in the <i>Clio</i> ten years
before the war, he had once shaken hands with the
King of Fiji, as eight bells went to call him on
watch. It was a happy inspiration which prompted
me to volunteer to go down and stand a part of his
watch with him in the stokehold, for once on his
own &ldquo;dung-hill,&rdquo; his restraint fell away from him
and he spoke easily and naturally of the things
which had befallen him there and on the deck
above.</p>

<p>There is little in the small, neat compartment
from which the oil fires of a modern destroyer are
fed and controlled to suggest the picture which the
name &ldquo;stokehold&rdquo; conjures up in the popular mind.
There is no coal, no grime, no sweating shovellers,
no clanging doors. Under ordinary conditions two
leisurely moving men do all there is need of doing,<!-- Page 61 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and with time to spare, and there are occasions at
sea, in the winter months, when the stokehold is a
more comfortable refuge than the chill fireless ward
room. It was my remarking upon the grateful
warmth of the stokehold after the cold wet wind
that was sweeping the deck, which finally turned
the current of Prince&rsquo;s reminiscence in the direction
I had been vainly endeavouring to deflect it for
the last hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all comfy enough, sir, when she&rsquo;s loafing
along at fifteen or twenty knots,&rdquo; he said, slipping
aside a &ldquo;flap&rdquo; and peering in at his fires with the
critical eye of a housewife surveying her oven of
bread, &ldquo;but just tumble in some time when, while
she already plugging away at full speed, the engine-room
rings up more steam. That&rsquo;s the time she&rsquo;s
just one little bit of hell down here, sir, with the
white sizzle of the fires turning the furnaces to a
red that shows even with the lights on, and the
plates underfoot getting so hot that you have to
keep dancing to prevent the soles of your boots
from catching fire. Why, long toward morning of
the night after Jutland&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take much man&oelig;uvring from that vantage
to back him up to the beginning for a fresh
start of the story of what is unquestionably one of
the most remarkable, as it was one of the most
successful, phases of the Jutland destroyer action.
The fact that, during the daylight action between
the battle cruisers, he had ample opportunity for<!-- Page 62 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
observation (through his being on deck standing
by in the event of emergency and without active
duties to perform) makes him undoubtedly one of
the most valuable witnesses of the opening phase
of this the greatest of all naval battles. The story
which I am setting down connectedly, he told me
in the comfortable intervals of his leisurely fire-trimming,
and, once he was warmed up to it, with
little prompting or questioning from myself. Much
of it was punctuated with frequent stabs and
slashes with one of the short-handled pokers which
perform for the stoker of an oil-burner a service
similar to that rendered his brother of the coal-burner
by his mighty &ldquo;slice&rdquo; of iron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big as the difference is between being on deck
and in the stokehold at ordinary times,&rdquo; said
Prince, turning round with glare-blinded eyes
closed to narrow slits after cracking off the accumulating
carbon from an oil-sprayer with his poker,
&ldquo;it is ten times more so when a fight is on, and I&rsquo;ll
always be jolly thankful that it was my luck not
to be caged up down here during the daylight part
of the Jutland show. I had my turn of it at night,
and it was bad enough then, even though I knew it
was blacker&rsquo;n the pit above; but, in daylight, with
everything in full view outside, I&rsquo;m not sure I
wouldn&rsquo;t have gone off my chuck if I&rsquo;d had to go
&lsquo;squirrel-caging&rsquo; on here with one eye on the fires
and the other on the Kilroy. But I didn&rsquo;t. It was
my luck to be off watch when the ball opened, so<!-- Page 63 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that my &lsquo;action station&rsquo; was just loafing round
the deck and keeping a stock of leak-stopping gear&mdash;mushroom-spreaders
and wooden plugs&mdash;ready
to use as soon as we got holed. Not having anything
to do with navigating the ship, or signalling, or
serving the guns or torpedo tubes&mdash;though I did get
a bit of a chance with a mouldie as it turned out&mdash;I
not only had time to see, but also to let the sights
&lsquo;sink in&rsquo; like. For that reason, when it was all
over, I was probably able to give a more connected
yarn of what happened than anyone else in the
ship, not excepting the captain. They&rsquo;ll take a lot
of forgetting, some of the things I saw that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince went over and settled down at ease on the
steel steps of the ladder. &ldquo;The worst grudge I had
against Jutland&mdash;save for the way it whiffed out
the lives of some of my friends in some of the other
destroyers&mdash;&rdquo; he continued with a grin, &ldquo;was for
making me miss my tea that afternoon. We left
base the night before, and about daybreak joined
up with the &lsquo;battlers,&rsquo; which was our way of speaking
of the First Battle Cruiser Squadron, to which
the flotilla was attached. It was a fairly decent
day, and we were able to make good weather of it
with the light wind and easy swell. I had stood the
forenoon watch, had a bit of a doss in my hammock
in the early part of the afternoon one, and had just
gone down to tea before going on for the &lsquo;First
Dog.&rsquo; There had been some buzz in the morning
about the Huns being out; but that was so old a<!-- Page 64 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
story that no one paid much attention to it. I was
just getting my nose over the edge of a mug of tea
when I heard the bos&rsquo;un growling &lsquo;Hands exercise
action stations,&rsquo; and tumbled out on deck to go
through the motions of getting ready for a fight
that would never come off, or leastways that was
how we felt about it. The &lsquo;battlers&rsquo; were speeding
up a bit, but there was not even a smudge of smoke
on the horizon to hint of Huns. After rigging the
fire-hoses and getting out my &lsquo;plugs,&rsquo; I stood by
for &lsquo;what next,&rsquo; but nothing happened. At the end
of half an hour the order &lsquo;Hands fall out&rsquo; was
passed, and, leaving everything rigged, down we
went to tea again. The mugs we had left were stone
cold by this time, and we were just raising a howl
for a fresh lot when, &lsquo;Bing!&rsquo; off goes the alarm
bells, and up we rushes again, this time to find
signs of what we had been looking and hoping for.
A good many hours went by before we went below
again, and all through the fight&mdash;when things would
ease off a bit now and then&mdash;I would hear the
&lsquo;matlos&rsquo; grousing about missing their afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old <i>Nairobi</i> was nosing along under the
port bow of the <i>Lion</i> as I came up, and so close that
we saw her guns&mdash;trained out abeam with a high
elevation, right above us. We seemed to be speeding
up to take station farther ahead. There was
nothing at all in sight (from the deck, at least;
though probably there was a better look-see from<!-- Page 65 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the bridge) in the direction the <i>Lion&rsquo;s</i> guns were
trained, and it was almost as if a bomb had been
dropped from the sky when a shell came plumping
down about half-way between our starboard quarter
and her port bow. The fact is, having heard no
sound of gunfire, I was so surprised that I foolishly
asked someone if the <i>Lion</i> hadn&rsquo;t blown out one of
her tompions testing a circuit. The spout of foam
should have told me better, but it goes to show what
crazy things run through a man&rsquo;s mind when he
can only see effect without the cause. A few
moments later I saw unmistakable gun-flashes
blinking along the skyline to south&rsquo;ard and knew
that at last we were under the fire of the Huns.
The next two or three shots fell singly, and were
plainly merely attempts to get the range. Following
the first &lsquo;short,&rsquo; there were one or two &lsquo;over,&rsquo;
and then a fair hit. This one, falling almost
straight, struck the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; of the <i>Lion</i>, penetrated
the deck and came out on the starboard side. I
don&rsquo;t think it exploded, and we were just far
enough ahead to see past her bows to where it
struck the water with a kind of spattery splash,
not at all like the clean spout thrown by a shell
which goes straight into the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there was a big spurt of flame from the
<i>Lion</i>, and the screech of shells reached my ears, even
before the heavy crash of her four-gun salvo. Watch
as I would, I could not make out the distant fall of
shot, but the fluttering flashes of the Hun guns to<!-- Page 66 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the south&rsquo;ard told where the target was. Firing
opened up all along the line of our battle cruisers
after that, and the racket from that and the fast
falling enemy shells increased till it was a steady
unbroken roar. The Hun shells were falling so
straight that many of the &lsquo;overs&rsquo; missed by only
a few yards. The hits, of which there were quite a
number on the leading ships, looked rather awful
at the moment of exploding. There would be a wild
gush of flame that seemed to be eating up everything
it touched, and then, all of a sudden, it was gone,
and only a few little fires would be left flickering on
the deck. The shells which struck against the sides
seemed to nip on into the sea almost before they
began to explode. Neither these, nor even those
which struck the decks and turrets, seemed to be
doing much damage at this stage, and our own
firing never slackened in the least. I think none of
the destroyers were hit up to now, though there
were a number of very near things from some of
the &lsquo;overs.&rsquo; Our turn was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sort of a give-and-take fight had been
going on for some time, when there was a sudden
increase of the enemy&rsquo;s fire. From the way the
fresh fall of shot came ranging up, it was very plain
that new ships were coming into action, while the
fact that the splashes were higher and heavier than
those from the first salvoes seemed to make it likely
that some of the Hun battleships had now arrived
at the party. As it turned out, this was just what<!-- Page 67 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
had happened, and, although we could not see them
from the low decks of the destroyers, the first
B.C.S. was soon under the fire of the whole Hun
High Seas Fleet. It was to draw these on into
action with our approaching Battle Fleet that
Beatty now turned away to the north&rsquo;ard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right here was where the big moment of this
part of the fight came. The Huns must have scented
the chance of catching our battle cruisers on the
&lsquo;windy corner&rsquo; as they turned, for suddenly their
fire slackened on the ships down the line and concentrated
on the point where that line began to
bend. It must have been something like the barrage
they make at the Front, for at times the water
thrown up by the bursting shell made a solid wall
which completely cut off my view of the ships beyond
it. The way it seemed to boil up and quiet
down looked like there was some sort of general
control over the bunched fire, though that sort of
thing would be pretty hard to handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Lion</i> caught only a corner of the &lsquo;boil,&rsquo; and
left it on her starboard quarter, but the shell or two
that struck her started a fierce fire burning &rsquo;midships,
and I did not see the guns of that turret again
in action. The &lsquo;P.R.&rsquo;&mdash;the <i>Princess Royal</i>&mdash;turned
in a quiet interval of the barrage, and seemed not to
be hit, but the <i>Queen Mary</i> steamed right into it,
and just seemed to dissolve in a big puff of smoke
and steam. I have no special memory of the noise
or shock of the explosion, but the pillar of smoke<!-- Page 68 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
shot up as sudden and solid as a &lsquo;Jack-in-the-box.&rsquo;
It was black underneath, but always with a crown
of flame at the top, as though the gases were spouting
up inside and taking fire as they met the air.
Some of my mates said they saw big pieces of flying
wreckage, such as plates from turrets and decks,
but I only remember smoke and flame. I never saw
a bit of the &lsquo;Q.M.&rsquo; again. When the smoke cloud
lifted she was gone completely, with nothing but a
gap in the line to mark the place where she had
been. The thing looked so impossible that the
&lsquo;T.I.&rsquo; (that was what we called the torpedo gunner&rsquo;s
mate, because he was also torpedo instructor), who
was standing beside me, kept saying over an over
again, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not gone up! She&rsquo;s not gone up!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was no more than a coincidence, but
it has always struck me as being just a bit uncanny
the way that barrage on the &lsquo;windy corner&rsquo; seemed
to &lsquo;work by threes.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Q.M.&rsquo; was third in line,
and up she went after the <i>Lion</i> and &lsquo;P.R.&rsquo; had
passed unhurt. Then the <i>Tiger</i> and <i>New Zealand</i>
weathered the turn safely, but the poor old <i>Indefat</i>.&mdash;Number
three again&mdash;got hers. She went up
under a rain of shells plumping down on her deck,
just as the &lsquo;Q.M.&rsquo; did, and I remember specially
watching the top of a turret go spinning up into the
air, till it almost disappeared, and then came slowly
down again, till it was lost in the rising smoke of
the explosion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire of the Huns began to be divided more<!-- Page 69 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
equally among the four surviving battle cruisers
now, and the <i>Nairobi</i> was led a lively dance dodging
about among the &lsquo;overs.&rsquo; It was the big fire raging
amidships that turned my eyes to the <i>Lion</i> again.
One of the guns of the &rsquo;midships turret had a sickly
droop to it, but the other three turrets were blazing
away as merry as ever. We were close enough to
see men on the bridge with the naked eye, and it
suddenly occurred to me that one of the quietly
moving figures there must be Admiral Beatty, who
I knew hated to be cooped up in a conning tower in
action. I could not be sure which he was, but everyone
in sight looked no more concerned than if they
had been steaming out for target practice. I didn&rsquo;t
have time to think of it then, but every time since
that I&rsquo;ve felt surer and surer that no man since the
world began ever showed more real guts than
Beatty in that part of the Jutland show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince stood up, and put a forty-five degree kink
in his poker by slamming it over the steel rail of the
ladder to emphasise his words, and then stopped
talking for a minute or two while he worried it
straight with a hammer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just about this time,&rdquo; he resumed, squinting
approvingly down the straightened bar, &ldquo;that
the <i>Nectar</i> hoisted the signal, &lsquo;Second Division prepare
for torpedo attack,&rsquo; and a few minutes later I
saw the whole flotilla start streaming out, some
ahead of the battle cruiser line, and some through
it, toward the Huns. I also have some memory of<!-- Page 70 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
seeing the &mdash;&mdash;th flotilla, smoking like young factory
chimneys, coming out astern of the line, but I had
no chance to see what became of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The range between us and the Huns had been
decreasing for some time, and the battle cruisers at
the head of the line loomed up pretty big and awful
as we started to close them. I&rsquo;ve never made quite
sure yet whether we were sent out to repel an attack
of the Hun destroyers, or whether they were sent
out to repel our attack. Anyhow, there they were,
filtering out through their battle cruisers just as we
had filtered through ours. We met and turned them
back something more than half-way between the
lines, but before we got to that point we had to
pass, first through the fire of the Hun heavies, and
then through a still hotter zone where their secondaries
were slapping down a barrage that took some
fancy side-stepping to avoid coming to grief in. The
<i>Onward</i> was the first of our division to fall by the
wayside. She stopped a &rsquo;leven-inch shell with her
engine-room, and got stopped in turn herself.
Luckily it didn&rsquo;t explode, or she would have been
blown out of the water then and there. I saw her
fall out of line and disappear in a cloud of steam,
and that was the last peep we had of her for many
weeks. When she finally rejoined the flotilla, we
learned that she and another cripple&mdash;the <i>Fencer</i>,
I think it was&mdash;had limped back home together. I
don&rsquo;t remember just where the <i>Wanderer</i> got hers,
but I think it must have been from the Hun&rsquo;s<!-- Page 71 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
secondaries. Anyhow, the first thing I remember
was that she was gone, and that the <i>Nectar</i> was
leading the <i>Nairobi</i>&mdash;all that was left of the division&mdash;on
a course to cross the bows of the enemy
battle cruisers. The Hun destroyers, which had no
chance with us in a gun fight, had now turned tail
and were heading back for the shelter of their battle
line. Several of them appeared on fire, but I didn&rsquo;t
see any sinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure what orders were made to
the flotilla at this time, but I rather think that after
the Hun attack had been stopped the signal was
hoisted to return to the battle cruisers. I think that
is what the other divisions did do, but for our division&mdash;or
what remained of it&mdash;things were looking
too promising just then to turn our backs on. I
was standing by the foremost tubes at the time, and
all of a sudden the Hun line began to turn away,
and I saw that the leading ship was being heavily
hit and that she was afire in two or three places. As
she turned she presented us a fine broadside target
at about three thousand yards, and the order came
from the bridge to &lsquo;Stand by foremost tubes and
fire when sights come on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turning of the Hun battle cruiser line exposed
us to the fire of a number of his light cruisers
which had been seeking shelter behind it, and some
smashing salvoes from these began to plump down
all around us just as we got ready to launch the torpedoes.
Though there was not one direct hit, we<!-- Page 72 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
were &lsquo;straddled&rsquo; a dozen times, and the foam
spouts tossed up by the shells exploding on striking
the water made a wall of smoke and spray that almost
shut off a view of our target. Shell fragments
were slamming up against the funnels and tinkling
on the decks, and I believe two or three men were
hit by them, though not much hurt. It was this sudden
savage shelling that spoiled the only chance we
had at the Hun big &rsquo;uns. Just as the sights were coming
on to the leading ship a salvo came down kerplump
right abreast of the foremost tubes, throwing
a solid spout of green water all over them. I saw
both mouldies start to slide out, but only one struck
the water and began to run. A moment later I saw
that the other, for some reason we never found out,
but probably because it had been knocked sideways
by the rush of water or perhaps a fragment of shell,
was hanging by its tail to the lip of the tube, with
its war-head full of gun-cotton trailing in the sea.
It cleared itself when the next sea slapped it against
the side, and started diving and jumping about like
a wounded porpoise, most likely because its propellers
had been knocked out. Luckily, our speed
carried us on before it had a chance to &lsquo;boomerang&rsquo;
back and blow up the old <i>Nairobi</i>. We could not
watch the first torpedo run on account of the spouts
from the falling shells, but though it started right
to cross the enemy&rsquo;s line, there was nothing to make
us believe it scored a hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before there was time to grieve over losing our<!-- Page 73 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
chance at the battle cruisers the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo; called me to
give him a hand with the &lsquo;midships&rsquo; tubes, as one
of his men had been knocked out. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a light
cruiser just going to bear for a shot,&rsquo; he yelled
from his seat between the tubes as I ran round to
the breech; &lsquo;jump up and tell me what speed she&rsquo;s
making. I can&rsquo;t see her fair from here.&rsquo; The trouble
was that the awful speed the <i>Nairobi</i> was going at
settled her down so low that, anywhere abaft the
bridge, a man couldn&rsquo;t see over the bow wave from
the deck. But, standing on top of the tubes, I was
high enough to get a good look at the Hun, when he
wasn&rsquo;t shut off by the spouts from the fall of shot.
He was a small three-funnelled light cruiser, and
every gun he had looked to be training on us.
Another cruiser astern of him was also firing on the
<i>Nairobi</i>, while two or three others were concentrating
on the <i>Nectar</i>. She was getting it even hotter
than we were, and all I could see of her&mdash;when one
of her zigzags brought her to one side or the other
so the bridge didn&rsquo;t cut her off from my view&mdash;was
some masts and funnels sliding along in the middle
of a dancing patch of foam fountains. Both <i>Nectar</i>
and <i>Nairobi</i> were replying for all they were worth
with their foremost guns; the after ones were too
low down to fire at such close range with much
effect. I saw one of our shells bursting on the Huns,
and why their shooting at us was so bad I have
never quite understood. The fact we were settled
so deep aft from our speed was plainly making a lot<!-- Page 74 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of shells ricochet over what would otherwise have
been hits, but, at the same time, the bows being so
much higher out of the water offered all the more
target for&rsquo;ard. It was more &lsquo;Joss&rsquo; than anything
else, I suppose. Besides, the <i>Nectar</i> was just on
the edge of getting hers anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw all these things out of the corner of my
eye like, for my mind was centred on getting what
the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo; wanted to know about his cruiser. I
knew just what this was to a &lsquo;t,&rsquo; for I&rsquo;d taken many
a turn of drill at the tubes. &lsquo;Parallel courses,
thousand yards range, speed about twenty-five,&rsquo; I
shouted, jumping down again; &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll have to
slip her right smart or you&rsquo;ll miss your chance.&rsquo;
Right then the seas flattened down for a few seconds,
and the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo;, giving me an order of how to
train her, set his sights and pulled the cocking
lever. A moment later he fired, and the mouldie
slipped out smooth and easy and started running
straight and true for a point the Hun was going to
arrive at about a minute later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince had been poking away at a sprayer as he
talked, with the fluttering light-mote from the fire
in the heart of the furnace playing on one of his
squinting eyes in a way that, with the other
quenched in shadow, gave his face a look of Cyclopean
fierceness. &ldquo;I jumped up on the tubes again to
follow our little tin fish on its swim,&rdquo; he resumed.
&ldquo;There seemed to be a bit of a flap on the cruiser,
for its next salvo fell a long way short of us. One<!-- Page 75 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of the shells&mdash;a five-or six-incher&mdash;did not explode,
but bounced off the water and came &lsquo;skip-jacking&rsquo;
along straight for us. It kicked into the water
twice before it reached us, the second time right
at the base of the wave that was rolling up and
hiding our sunken stern, and that seemed to give
it just enough of an up-flip to make it clear the
<i>Nairobi&rsquo;s</i> shivering hull. It came so slow that I
caught the glint of the copper band round its base,
and so low that the after superstructure blotted it
off from my sight as it passed over the stern. One of
the after gun&rsquo;s crew told me he could have reached
up and patted it as it tumbled along over his head.
He said it was going so slow that he hardly felt any
wind at all from it. Perhaps that was because he
had his own wind up, though, for it was making a
great buzz, and must have been carrying a big
&lsquo;tail&rsquo; of air in its wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost track of our mouldie when I ducked&mdash;no,
I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that&rsquo;s just what I did,
though it missed me by a mile&mdash;and before I could
get my eye on its wake again it had gone home. I
think they must have spotted it coming on the
cruiser, for I saw her begin to alter course away
just about the time I figured it was due to arrive.
If they were altering to avoid the mouldie, they
turned the wrong way, for it only brought right
abreast the funnels what&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo; been a hit somewhere
about the bridge. I&rsquo;ve got a picture in my mind
of what happened that I&rsquo;m dead certain is as true<!-- Page 76 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
as a photograph, and the spout of water that went
up must have been almost exactly amidships. If
the hit had been anywhere for&rsquo;rard it would never
have broken her back the way it did, and she might
have got away. The funny part of it was that it
was not the &rsquo;midships section of her, where the
mouldie hit, that seemed to be lifted by the explosion.
That part of her seemed just to go to
pieces and begin to sink all at once, while the bow
and stern halves started to come up and close together
like a jack-knife. She must have gone down
inside of a minute or two, but things were happening
so fast I don&rsquo;t think I was looking when she
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince, engrossed in his story, forgot that the end
of his poker had a sheet of flame playing upon it,
and the heat which crept back from the rosy-red tip
gave his palm a sharp singe as he clutched the
handle preparatory to executing one of his sweeping
gestures. From then on to the end of his narrative
he paused frequently to lick with his tongue
the blistered cuticle, the stoker&rsquo;s sovereign remedy
for a slight burn. &ldquo;I was just starting to give the
&lsquo;T.I.&rsquo; an account of what I had had a lot better
chance to see than he had,&rdquo; he went on thickly,
still touching the blisters gingerly with an extended
tongue-tip, &ldquo;when I heard him growl, &lsquo;Stand by!
here&rsquo;s another one. What speed d&rsquo;you think she&rsquo;s
making?&rsquo; I was still standing up on top of the
tubes, and&mdash;to get a better view&mdash;right in front of<!-- Page 77 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo;, with my waist on just about the level of
his face. As I turned my head to look at the second
Hun he straddled us fair with a full salvo.
Most of it went over, but one proj struck right
alongside and just about flooded us out. But there
was something heavier than water that it sent
aboard. I felt a sharp sting across my stomach,
as if someone had given me a cut with a whip. As
I put my hand down to it the whole front of my
overall dropped away where a fragment of shell
casing had shot across it. A few threads&mdash;I found
out later&mdash;had been started on my singlet, but my
hide was not even scratched. I heard the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo; give
a yell, and when I looked round saw his face
covered with blood, and a flap of skin from his forehead
hanging down over one eye like a skye terrier&rsquo;s
ear. The piece of proj had caught him a nasty
side-swipe, though without hurting anything but
his looks in the least. And it wasn&rsquo;t that he was
yelling about, either, but at me for not giving him
the course and speed of the second cruiser. He had
the flap of skin tied up out of his eye&mdash;using a strip
of my overall because neither of us could find a
handkerchief&mdash;by the time I was back at the handle.
I saw the blood dribbling over his sights, but he
seemed to be seeing through them all right, for he
was telling me how to train when I felt the helm
begin to grind as it was thrown hard over to make
a sudden alteration of course. She heeled fifteen
or twenty degrees as she turned six points to starboard,<!-- Page 78 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and the boil of her wake flooded across her
stern three or four feet deep. The sudden heel
threw me off my feet, and I pulled up just in time
to see us rushing by, and just missing by a few
yards, a stopped destroyer that was nothing but
spurts of fire flashing under a rolling cloud of
steam and smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seemed to be afire all over, and about ready
to blow up; yet, from the quick flashes of some of
the spurts of fire, I knew they came from a hard-pumped
gun that some stout-hearted lads were
working to the last. There was nothing in the look
of that spouting volcano of smoke and steam that
would help a man to tell whether it was a battleship
or a trawler, but I knew that it could be only
the <i>Nectar</i>, our Division leader. We never saw
her nor anyone in her again. She must have gone
down within a few minutes, and anyone that survived
fell into the hands of the enemy. She led us
a fine dance while it lasted, and the only pity was
that she couldn&rsquo;t trip it to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That left the old <i>Nairobi</i> as the last of the Division,
and I haven&rsquo;t any recollection of any of the
rest of the flotilla being in sight by then. Not that
I had any time to look for them, though. Our sudden
change of course to keep from ramming the
<i>Nectar</i> spoiled our chance at the second Hun
cruiser, but we were left no time to mourn that any
more than the finish of the <i>Nectar</i>. Hardly had we
left the wreck of her astern than a full salvo of<!-- Page 79 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
large shells&mdash;I think they must have come from one
of the battle cruisers, for they were much heavier
than anything the light cruisers were firing&mdash;struck
only thirty or forty yards short of us. The shells
were bunched together like a salvo of air-bombs
kicked loose all at once. The wall of water they
threw up shut everything on that side off from
sight for a few seconds, and when the spouts settled
down there was a Hun destroyer inside of a mile
away. I jumped up to give her course and speed to
the &lsquo;T.I.&rsquo;, but before I had time more than to see
that she had two funnels and many tubes the bursting
projes from our foremost and midships guns
began knocking her to pieces so fast that I soon saw
there was no use of wasting a mouldie on the job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the captain waving encouragement from
the bridge to the crew of the midships guns, and,
when the noise died down for a moment, I heard
him shout, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got her! Give it to her!&rsquo; Just
then another salvo was plastered a-straddle of us,
and I saw a fragment of shell knock the sight-setter
of the midships gun out of his seat. He looked a
little dazed as he climbed back, but his eye must
have been as good as ever, for I saw his next shot
make a hit square on a whaler they were lowering
from the sinking Hun and blow it to bits. A minute
or two more, and the destroyer itself blew up and
disappeared under a column of steam and smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; continued Prince, beginning to prod
anew his neglected sprayers, &ldquo;just about concluded<!-- Page 80 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
our day&rsquo;s work. As there was no longer any prospect
of getting in mouldie-range of any of the big
Huns, and as none of the little Huns were in sight
to fight with gun-fire, it must have occurred to the
captain that it was time he was rejoining the
flotilla. There was only some dark blurs on the
north&rsquo;ard skyline to steer for at first, and the Huns
did all they knew to keep us from getting there,
too. For a while we were doing nothing but playing
&lsquo;hide-and-seek&rsquo; among the salvoes they tried to
stop us with, and I have heard since that the way
the captain used his helm to avoid being hit at this
stage of the show was rated as about the cleverest
work of the kind in the whole battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the Fifth B.S.&mdash;the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>
class&mdash;that we caught up to first, and a grand sight
it was, the four of them standing up and giving
battle to about the whole of the High Sea Fleet.
They were taking a heavy pounding without turning
a hair, so far as a man could see, and even when
the <i>Warspite</i> had her steering gear knocked out
and went steaming in circles it didn&rsquo;t seem to upset
the other three very much. We sighted our own
Battle Fleet about six, and rejoined the flotilla in
good time to be back with the battle cruisers when
Beatty took them round the head of the Hun line
and only failed to cut off their retreat through
night coming on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compared with what the next six or eight
hours held for some of our destroyers&mdash;or even<!-- Page 81 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with what we had just been through ourselves&mdash;the
night for us was fairly quiet. We were in
action once or twice, and I saw several ships&mdash;mostly
enemy, but one or two of our own&mdash;go up
in flame and smoke before I went on watch down
here at midnight. But through it all the devil&rsquo;s
own luck which had been with us from the first
held good. Although we were through the very
hottest of the day action, and not the least of the
night, the old <i>Nairobi</i> did not receive one direct hit
from an enemy shell. She accounted for at least
two Hun ships, saw the other three destroyers of
her division sunk or put out of action, and returned
to base with almost empty oil tanks and perhaps
the largest mileage to her credit of any craft in
the Jutland battle&mdash;all without a serious casualty
or more than a few scratches to her paint. On top
of it all, on the way back to harbour, by the queerest
fluke you ever heard of, she rammed and exploded
the air-chamber of a mouldie that had been
fired by a Hun U-boat at the destroyer next in line
ahead of her. As the Yanks say, &lsquo;Can you beat
it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>HUNTING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s destroyer work you want, there are five
of them getting under weigh at four
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Senior Officer Present,&rdquo;
looking at his watch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have just about
time to pick up your luggage and connect if you
want to go. I can&rsquo;t tell you what they&rsquo;re going to
do&mdash;they won&rsquo;t know that themselves till they get
to sea, and their orders may be changed from hour
to hour, and things may happen to send them to
the Channel, France, or to several other places, on
and off the chart, before they put in here again.
But there&rsquo;ll be work to do&mdash;plenty of it. That&rsquo;s
the best part of this corner of the North Atlantic
in which our Allies have done the American destroyers
the honour of setting them on the U-boats.
Whatever else you may suffer from, it won&rsquo;t be
from ennui.&rdquo; It was luck indeed, on two hours&rsquo;
notice, to have the chance of getting out in just the
way I had planned, where I had been quite prepared
to stand-by for twice as many days, and I
fell in with the arrangement at once.</p>

<p>Captain X&mdash;&mdash; ran his eye down a board where
the names of a number of destroyers were displayed<!-- Page 83 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
against certain data indicating their whereabouts
and disposition. &ldquo;<i>Zop</i>, <i>Zap</i>, <i>Zip</i>, <i>Zim</i>,
<i>Zam</i>,&rdquo; he read musingly. &ldquo;<i>Zip</i>&mdash;yes, I don&rsquo;t think
I can do better than send you on the <i>Zip</i>. Her
skipper is as keen as he is able, and the <i>Zip</i> herself
has the reputation of having something of a nose
for U-boats on her own account. I&rsquo;ll advise him
you&rsquo;re coming. Pick up your sea togs and put off
to her as soon as you can. Good luck.&rdquo; The
American naval officer, like the British, never says
&ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; if it can possibly be avoided.</p>

<p>They were already preparing to unmoor as I
clambered over the side of the <i>Zip</i>, and by the time
I had shifted to sea-boots and oilskins in the captain&rsquo;s
cabin&mdash;which, unoccupied by himself during
that strenuous interval, was to be mine at sea&mdash;she
was swinging in the stream and nosing out into the
creaming wakes of the two of her dazzle-painted
sisters who were preceding her down the bay.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There are several things that strike one as different
on going to an American warship after a spell in
a British ship of the same class, but the one which
surges to meet you and goes to your head like wine
is the all-pervading spirit of vibrant, sparkling, unquenchable
youthfulness. Everything you see and
hear seems to radiate it&mdash;every throb of the engines,
every beat of the screws&mdash;and at first you
may almost get the impression that it comes from
the ship herself. But when you start to trace it<!-- Page 84 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
down, you find it bubbles from a single fount, the
men, or rather the boys&mdash;the lounging, laughing,
devil-may-care boys. Theirs the alchemy to transform
every one and everything that comes near
them into the golden seeming of themselves.</p>

<p>This youthfulness of the American destroyers is
in the crew rather than the officers, for the latter&mdash;especially
the captain and executive&mdash;will average,
if anything, a shade older than their &ldquo;opposite
numbers&rdquo; in a British destroyer. There is a certain
minimum of highly specialised work in navigating
and fighting a destroyer which must be in
the hands of officers and men who can have only
attained the requisite training in long years of
technical study and practical experience. Given
these, and the remainder of the ship&rsquo;s company&mdash;provided
only that they have digestive organs that
will continue to function when tilted through a
dozen different slants and angles in as many seconds&mdash;can
be trained to perfection in an astonishingly
short time. Here it is that America has
scored, for there is no doubt that the youngsters
that have rushed to enrol themselves for her destroyer
service are better educated and quicker in
mind and body than those available for any other
navy in the war. It is the incomparable adaptability
these advantages have conspired to give him
that has made the Yankee destroyer rating a combination
of keenness and efficiency that leaves little,
if anything, to be desired on either score.<!-- Page 85 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the way a British naval officer who is
familiar with the work of the American destroyer
flotilla expressed himself in this connection: &ldquo;The
ship&rsquo;s company of any one of these American destroyers,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;will average a good five years
younger than that of a British destroyer. Off
hand, one would say that this would tell against
them, but, as a matter of fact, quite the contrary
is the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that the command and the technical operations
are in the hands of highly trained and
fairly serious-minded officers, you can&rsquo;t have too
much slapbang, hell-for-leather, devil-take-the-consequences
spirit in the ship&rsquo;s company. And where
will you find that save in the youngsters&mdash;tireless,
fearless, careless boys. They&rsquo;ve found that out in
the air services, and we&rsquo;re finding it out in the destroyers.
And right there&mdash;in these quick-headed,
quick-footed super-boys of theirs&mdash;is where the Yankee
destroyers have the best of us. It is they&mdash;working
under consummately clever officers&mdash;that
enabled the American destroyer flotilla to reach
in a stride a working efficiency which we had been
straining up to for three years.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The green hills astern had turned grey and dissolved
in mist and darkness before the captain was
able to announce what work was afoot for us. The
<i>Zim</i> and <i>Zam</i>, it appeared, were to be detached on
some mission of their own, while the <i>Zop</i>, <i>Zap</i>,<!-- Page 86 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and <i>Zip</i>, after &ldquo;hunting&rdquo; submarines for some
time, were to proceed to a certain port, pick up the
<i>Lymptania</i>, and escort her through the danger
zone on her westward voyage. The captain was
grinning as he finished reading the order. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
give you any definite assurance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
the hunt part of the stunt is going to scare up any
U-boats, although the prospects this week are more
promising than for some time; but&rdquo;&mdash;he turned
his level gaze to the westward, where the in-rolling
Atlantic swells were blotting with undulant humps
the fading primrose of the narrow strip of after-glow&mdash;&ldquo;if
this wind and sea keep the same force
and direction for three or four days more, I&rsquo;ll
promise you all the excitement your heart can desire
when we take on our escort duties. The last
time we took out the old <i>Lymptania</i>&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve
got marks on me yet from the corners I got banged
up against, and as for the poor little <i>Zip</i>&mdash;but she&rsquo;s
had a refit since and most of the scars have been
removed. As you will have ample chance to see
for yourself, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of <i>dolce far niente</i> in
any of this life we lead in connection with our little
game here, but if there is one phase of our activities
that is farther removed from &lsquo;peace, perfect peace&rsquo;
than any other, it is trying to screen an ex-Atlantic
greyhound that is boring at umpty-ump knots into
a head wind and sea. Strafing U-boats is a Sunday-school
picnic in comparison at any time; but
it will be worse this week because they have just<!-- Page 87 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
put down a couple of big liners, and the skipper of
the <i>Lymptania</i>, knowing they will be laying for
him, will force her like he was trying to get his
company the trans-Atlantic mail subsidy. For us
to cut zigzags around that kind of a thing&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll be able to judge for yourself. I only hope
we can catch you a U-boat or two by way of preliminary,
so as to lead up to the climax by slow
degrees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things were fairly comfy that night&mdash;that is, as
comfort goes in a destroyer. There was a good stiff
wind and a good deal more than a lop of sea running;
but as both were coming on the quarter and
we were plodding along at no great speed, the <i>Zip</i>
made very passable weather of it. The bridge, save
for occasional showers of light spray where a sea
slapped over the side, was quite dry, and even on
the long run of low deck amidships there were several
havens of refuge where the men off watch could
foregather to smoke and yarn without fear of more
than an occasional spurt of brine. A dry deck
does not chance every day that a destroyer is on
business bent at sea, and when it does, like sunshine
in Scotland, is a thing to luxuriate in.</p>

<h4>&ldquo;KAMERADING&rdquo; WITH UPLIFTED PAWS</h4>


<p>As the twilight deepened and melted into the
light of a moon that was but a day or two from the
full&mdash;&ldquo;bad luck for the <i>Lymptania</i> convoy, that
moon,&rdquo; the captain had said as he noted how it was
waxing on his chart&mdash;I came down from the bridge
and worked along from group to group of the sailor<!-- Page 88 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
men where, lounging and laughing, they sheltered
in the lee of funnel and boat and superstructure.
The first one I pushed into was centred round a
discussion, or rather an argument, between two
boys, the one from Kansas and the other from
Oklahoma, as to which had raised the best and
biggest corn in the course of some sort of growing
competitions they had once taken part in. Several
others standing about also appeared to have come
from one or other of those fine naval-recruiting
States of the Middle West, and seemed to know
not a little about intensive maize culture themselves.
I was just ingratiating myself with this
party by nodding assent and voicing an emphatic
&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s query of &ldquo;Some corn that, mister,
hey?&rdquo; when I discovered a cosmopolitan group
(two Filipino stewards, the coloured cook, and
three or four bluejackets in sleeveless grey
sweaters) collaborating in the arduous task of
teaching a very sad-faced white mongrel to sit up on
his haunches and beg. Or rather it was an elaboration
of that classic trick. On drawing nearer I
perceived that the lugubrious-visaged canine
already had mastered begging for food, and that
now they were endeavouring to teach him to beg
for mercy. At the order &ldquo;Kamerad!&rdquo; instead of
sitting with down-drooping paws, he was being
instructed to raise the latter above his head and
give tongue to a wail of entreaty. He was a
brighter pup than his looks would have indicated,<!-- Page 89 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
and had already become letter perfect in the wail.
&ldquo;Kamerading&rdquo; properly with uplifted paws, however,
was rather too much for his balance, at least
while teetering on the edge of a condensed milk
case which was itself sliding about the deck of a
careening destroyer. The dog had been christened
&ldquo;Ole Oleson,&rdquo; one of the sailors told me, both because
he was &ldquo;some kind of a Swede&rdquo; and because,
like his famous namesake, he had tried to come
aboard in &ldquo;two jumps&rdquo; the day they found him
perched on a bit of wreckage of the Norwegian
barque to which he had belonged, and which had
been sunk by a U-boat an hour previously. The men
seemed to be very fond of him, and I overheard the
one who picked him up off the box to make a place
for me to sit on, whisper into his cocked ear that
they were going to try to catch a Hun in the next
day or two for him to sharpen his teeth on.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>These boys told me a number of stories in connection
with the survivors they had rescued, or
failed to rescue, from ships sunk by U-boats. Most
of them were the usual accounts of firing on open
boats in an attempt to sink without a trace, but
there was one piquant recital which revealed the
always diverting Hun sense of humour at a new
slant. This was displayed, as it chanced, on the
occasion of the sinking of &ldquo;Ole&rsquo;s&rdquo; ship, the Norwegian
barque. After this unlucky craft had been put
down by shell-fire and bombs, the U-boat ran alongside<!-- Page 90 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the whaler containing the captain and mate,
and they were ordered aboard to be interrogated.
Under the pretence of preventing any attempt to
escape on the part of the remainder of those in
this boat, the Germans made them clamber up and
stand on the narrow steel run-way which serves as
the upper deck of a submarine. No sooner were
they here, however, than the Hun humorist on the
bridge began slowly submerging. When the water
was lapping round the necks of the unfortunate
Norwegians, and just threatening to engulf them,
the nose of the U-boat was slanted up again, this
finely finessed operation being repeated during all
of the time that the captain and mate were being
pumped below by the commander of the submarine.
No great harm&mdash;save that one of the sailors, losing
his nerve when the U-boat started down the first
time, dived over, struck his head on one of the bow-rudders
and was drowned&mdash;was done by this little
pleasantry, but it is so illuminative of what the
Hun is in his lightsome moods that I have thought
it worth setting down.</p>

<p>The American is more violent in his feelings than
the Briton, and much more inclined to say what he
thinks; and I found these boys&mdash;to use the expressive
phrase of one of them&mdash;&ldquo;mad clean
through&rdquo; at the Hun pirate and all he stands for.
America&mdash;with more time to do that sort of thing&mdash;has
undoubtedly gone farther than any other
country in the war in trying to give her soldiers
and sailors a proper idea of the beast they have<!-- Page 91 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
been sent out to slay. These lessons seem to have
sunk home with all of them, and when it has been
supplemented&mdash;as in the case of the sailors in the
destroyers&mdash;by the first-hand teachings of the Huns
themselves, it generally leaves a man in something
like the proper state of mind for the task in hand.
Not that I really think any of the Americans, when
they have the chance, as happens every now and
then, will carry out all the little plans they claim to
be maturing, but&mdash;well, if I was an exponent of the
U-boat branch of German kultur, and my <i>unterseeboot</i>
was depth-charged by a British and an American
destroyer, and I came sputtering up to the surface
midway between them, I don&rsquo;t think I would
strike out for the lifebuoy trailing over the quarter
of the one flying the Stars and Stripes. I may be
wrong, but somehow I have the feeling that the
Briton&mdash;be he soldier, sailor, or civilian&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
quite the same capacity as the Yank for keeping up
the temperature of his passion, for feeling &ldquo;mad
clean through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joining another group bunched in the lee of a
tier of meat-safes, I chanced upon a debate which
threw an illuminative beam on the feelings of what
might once have been classified as hyphenated
Americans. At first the whole six or eight of them,
in all harmony and unanimity, had been engaged
in cursing Sinn Feiners, with whom it appeared
they had been having considerable contact&mdash;physical<!-- Page 92 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and otherwise&mdash;in the course of the last few
months. Then one of the more rabid of them on
this particular subject&mdash;he and one of his mates
had been waylaid and beaten by a dozen hulking
young Irishmen who resented the attentions the
Yankees were receiving from the local girls&mdash;threw
a bone of dissension into the ring by declaring that
a Sinn Feiner was as bad as a Hun and ought to
be treated the same way.</p>

<p>The most of them could hardly bring themselves
to agree to this, but in the rather mixed argument
which followed it transpired that the lad who had
led the attack on Sinn Fein was named Morarity
and had been born in Cork, and that the one who
maintained that nothing on two legs, not even a
Sinn Feiner, was as &ldquo;ornery as a Hun,&rdquo; was
named Steinholz, and had been born in St. Louis
of German parents.</p>

<p>The wherefore of this they explained to me
severally presently, when it turned out that their
views&mdash;as regards their duties as Americans&mdash;were
precisely similar. Like all good Yankees, they said,
they had it in for both the Hun and the Sinn
Feiner; but, because each of them had a <i>name</i> to
live down, he felt it incumbent on himself to out-strafe
his mates in the direction from which that
name came. It was a bit na&iuml;ve, that confession, but
at the same time highly instructive; and I wouldn&rsquo;t
care to be the Hun or Sinn Feiner that either of
those ex-hyphenates had a fair chance at.<!-- Page 93 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>A very domestic little party I found cuddled up
aft among the depth-charges. One lad&mdash;he had been
a freshman at Cornell, I learned later, and would
not wait to train for a commission, so keen had he
been to get into the war&mdash;was just back from a
week&rsquo;s leave in London, and was telling about it
with much circumstance. There were many things
that had interested and amused him, but the great
experience had been three days spent as a guest in
an English home at Wimbledon. The head of the
family, it appeared, was some kind of a City man,
and, encountering the doubtless aimlessly wandering
Yank at Waterloo, had forthwith carried him
home. Everything had bristled with interest for
the young visitor, from the marmalade at breakfast
and the port at dinner to croquet on the lawn and
a punt on the Thames at Richmond. But the best
of it all had been that he had brought a standing
invitation from the same family to any of his mates
who might be coming up to London while the war
was on. During the refit, which was supposed to
be imminent, two of these, who had plumped for
the great London adventure, had screwed up their
courage to following up the invitation to the hospitable
home in question. Out of his broader experience,
their worldly mate was tipping them off
against possible breakers. This is the only one I
remember: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find,&rdquo; he said, gesturing with
an admonitory finger that could just be dimly
guessed against the phosphorescence of the tossing<!-- Page 94 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
wake, &ldquo;that they don&rsquo;t seem to have any great
grudge &rsquo;gainst us for licking them and going on our
own in &rsquo;76; but go easy on rubbing it in just the
same, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re a guest in the house. Best forget
the Revolution while you&rsquo;re over here. That
scrap was more&rsquo;n a hundred years ago, and we&rsquo;ve
got another on now. Half the people you meet
here never heard of it, anyhow, and when you mention
it to them they think you refer to another
Revolution in France which came off about the
same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at about this juncture that a change of
course brought seas which had been quartering a
couple of points forward of the beam, and in a
jiffy the swift spurts of brine had searched out the
last dry corner of the deck and sent scurrying to
shelter every man who had not a watch to stand.
Three times I was completely drenched in groping
forward from the after-superstructure to the ward-room,
under the bridge, so that I was a good deal
inclined to take it as a joke&mdash;and a rather ill-timed
one at that&mdash;when an ensign about to turn in on
one of the transoms muttered something about
being thankful that we were going to have <i>one</i>
quiet night when a man could snatch a wink of
sleep. I asked him if he referred to the night we
expected to be in port waiting for the <i>Lymptania</i>,
but the fact that he had already dozed off proved
that he really had not been trying to be funny at
my expense. Indeed, it was a fairly quiet night, as<!-- Page 95 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
nights go in destroyers; but, even so, I needed a
good high sideboard to keep from rolling out of
the captain&rsquo;s bunk, and then two sofa pillows and
my overcoat to keep from pulping my shoulder
against the sideboard.</p>

<p>We were still sliding easily along at the same
comfortable umpteen knots in the morning, but
with the breaking of the new day a subtle change
had come over the spirit of the ship. It was just
such a change as one might observe in a hunter as
he passes from a plain, where there is little cover,
to a wood where every tree and bush may hide
potential quarry. And that, indeed, was precisely
the way it was with us. The night before we were
&ldquo;on our way&rdquo;; this morning we were ploughing
waters where U-boats were <i>known</i> to be operating.
It was only a couple of days previously that the
good old <i>Carpathia</i> had been put down, and not
many hours had passed since then but what brought
word, by one or another of the almost countless
ways that have been devised to trace them, of an
enemy submarine working in those waters. We
were ready enough the night before, ready for anything
that might have turned up; but this morning
we were more than that.</p>

<p>There was a new tenseness now, and a feeling in
the air like that which follows the click-click after
a trigger is set to &ldquo;hair.&rdquo; It was as though everyone,
everything, even the good little <i>Zip</i> herself,
was crouched for a spring.</p>

<h4>HELPING THE COOK TO PEEL POTATOES</h4>

<p>There was an amusing little incident I chanced<!-- Page 96 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to see which illustrates the keenness of the spirit
animating the men even in the moments of waiting.
A favourable course had left the deck unswept by
water for an hour, and a half-dozen boys, off watch,
but too restless to turn in, were trying to kill time
by helping the cook peel potatoes. It was one of
these whom I saw stand up, take several swift
strides forward across the reeling deck, draw a rag
from the pocket of his &ldquo;jeans,&rdquo; and then, with great
care and deliberation, begin to polish a patch of
steel plate that was exposed in the angle of two
strips of coco-matting. &ldquo;Wha&rsquo; cher holystoning
deck yetawhile fer, Pete?&rdquo; one of his mates shouted.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;cher wait till we gets back to port? We may
have to foul your pretty work with greasy Huns
any minnit.&rdquo; Unperturbed, Pete went right on
rubbing, testing the footing every now and then
with the sole of his boot. Only when the job, whatever
it was, was done to suit his fastidious taste
did he return to his seat on the reversed water-bucket
and start peeling potatoes again. Not till
a full dozen or more neatly skinned Murphies had
passed under his knife did he vouchsafe to reply to
the half-curious, half-pitying looks and remarks
his mates had continued to direct at him. Then
his explanation was as crushing as complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t look much as if you guys wants to get
a Hun,&rdquo; he observed finally, running a critical eye
over them. &ldquo;Oh, you do, do you? My mistake.<!-- Page 97 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Well, then, don&rsquo;t try to be funny with another guy
that&rsquo;s doing his best to effect that same good end.
Now looka here. From where I sits to my gun-station
is just six steps. Six for me, I mean; it&rsquo;d
be more for most of you &lsquo;shorties.&rsquo; Now I just
figures that step number four lands my foot square
in the dribble of oil on that patch where there ain&rsquo;t
no matting; so what was more natural than for
me to go and swab it up. Last time the gong
binged I hit half a preserved peach, and sprained
a wrist and ankle so bad that I woulda been dead
slow on the gun if we&rsquo;d had to fire it. Keeping my
eye peeled for another piece of peach, I pipes that
gob of oil, and so goes and gets rid of it. It&rsquo;s painful
having to explain a simple thing like that to
you bone-heads, but, now that you got it, p&rsquo;raps
you&rsquo;ll ease off on your beefing, and peel spuds.
<i>That</i> don&rsquo;t take no brains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three times in the course of the morning
the look-out&rsquo;s shout of &ldquo;Sail!&rdquo; bearing this way or
that, brought those in sound of it to their feet in the
expectation that it would be followed by the welcome
clanging of the alarm bell; and once or twice
the wireless picked up the S.O.S.&mdash;they do not
send it out that way now, but these letters are still
the common term in use to describe the call of a
ship in distress&mdash;of a steamer that had been torpedoed.
But the sails turned out to be friends in
every case, while both of the ships reported sinking
were too far away for us to be of any use to them.<!-- Page 98 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Early in the afternoon a suspiciously cruising
craft, which proved presently to be a friend, got a
high-explosive shell under her nose as a consequence
of her deliberation in revealing that fact.
The smartness with which the men tumbled to
quarters, and the almost uncanny speed with which
the forecastle gun was served, boded well for developments
in case the real thing turned up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you always fire a blank across their bows
when you don&rsquo;t quite like the look of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; I
asked the captain innocently, as he gazed dejectedly
through his glass at certain unmistakable evidences
proving that he had been cheated of his quarry.
&ldquo;Blank!&rdquo; indignation and half the look that sits
on the face of a terrier who discovers that he has
cornered his own family&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tabby&rdquo; instead of the
neighbour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tom&rdquo;; &ldquo;blank!&mdash;did you ever see a
blank &lsquo;X-point-X&rsquo; that threw up a spout as high
as a masthead, and all black with smoke? That
was the worst punisher we have in our lockers;
and, what&rsquo;s more, it was meant to be a hit. And the
next one would have been,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
afford to waste any time where five or ten seconds
may make all the difference between bagging and
losing a Hun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about bagging something that isn&rsquo;t
a Hun?&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;I told you, I think, that
I had arranged to go out next week on patrol in
one of the American submarines; but after what
I&rsquo;ve just seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<!-- Page 99 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The burden of proof is up to the craft under
suspicion,&rdquo; cut in the captain, &ldquo;and they ought to
have no trouble in supplying it if they have their
wits about them.&rdquo; Then, with a grin, &ldquo;But if
you&rsquo;re really going out on submarine patrol next
week, why&mdash;I&rsquo;ll promise to look twice before turning
loose one of those&mdash;those &lsquo;blanks.&rsquo;&rdquo; How he
kept his word is another story.</p>

<p>It was about an hour or two later that the wireless
winged word that seemed at last to herald the
real thing. It was the S.O.S. of a steamer, and
conveyed merely the information that she had just
been torpedoed, with her latitude and longitude.
The position given was only thirty or forty miles
to the northward, and though the name in the message&mdash;it
was <i>Namoura</i> or something similar&mdash;could
not be found on any of our shipping lists,
the <i>Zop</i>, as senior ship, promptly ordered course
altered and full speed made in the hope of arriving
on the scene in time to be of some use. With every
minute likely to be of crucial importance, it was
not an occasion to waste time by waiting or asking
for orders. A swift exchange of signals between
ships, a hurried order or two down a voice-pipe, an
advancing of the handle of the engine-room telegraph,
a throwing over of the wheel, and we had
spun in the welter of our tossing wake and were
off on a mission that might prove one of either
mercy or destruction, or, quite conceivably, both.
The formation in which we had been cruising when<!-- Page 100 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the signal was received gave the <i>Zip</i> something like
a mile lead at the get-away, and this&mdash;though one
of the others was a newer and slightly faster ship&mdash;she
held gallantly to the end of the race. By a
lucky chance, though there was a snoring wind and
a lumpy sea running, the course brought both abaft
the beam and permitted us to run nearly &ldquo;all out&rdquo;
without imposing a serious strain on the ship. The
difference between running before and bucking into
seas of this kind I was to learn in a day or two.
For the moment, conditions were all that could be
asked to favour our getting with all dispatch into
whatever game there was to be played.</p>

<p>Many a so-called express train has travelled
slower than any one of those three destroyers was
ploughing its way through solid green water. For
a few seconds after &ldquo;Full speed!&rdquo; had been rung
down to their engine-rooms, swift-spinning smoke
rings had shot up from their funnels and gone
reeling off down to leeward; then, with perfect
synchronisation of draught and oil, the duskiness
above the mouths of the stumpy stacks had cleared,
and only the mirage on the horizon astern betrayed
the up-spouting jets of hot gases. Only the vibrant
throb of the speeding engines&mdash;so pervading that
it seemed to pulse like heart-beats through the
very steel itself&mdash;gave hint of the mightiness of the
effort that speed was costing. With that throb
stilled&mdash;and the mounting wake quenched&mdash;the progress
of that thousand tons or so of steam-driven<!-- Page 101 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
steel would have seemed scarcely less effortless than
that of an aeroplane.</p>

<p>An order from the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;which
was picked up presently&mdash;to go to the assistance of
the torpedoed ship and to &ldquo;hunt submarine&rdquo; had
been anticipated; but the real name of the steamer&mdash;finally
transmitted correctly&mdash;brought to me at
least a distinct shock. It was H.M.S. <i>Marmora</i>,
and the <i>Marmora</i>, the former P. &amp; O. Australian
liner, was an old friend. To anyone who loves the
sea a ship, no matter of what kind, has a personality.
But in the case of a ship in which he has
sailed&mdash;lived in, worked and played in, been happy
in, perhaps gone through certain dangers in&mdash;has
more than a personality, it has a place in his heart.
Many and many a morning since the first U-boat
campaign was started I had read&mdash;and never without
a lump rising in my throat&mdash;of the passing of
just such a friend, of the going out of the world of
something&mdash;almost of &ldquo;some one&rdquo;&mdash;which I had
always looked forward to seeing again. <i>Afric</i>,
<i>Arabic</i>, <i>Aragon</i>, I knew their names well enough to
compile the list alphabetically. It would have run
to some score in length, and from every name would
have led a long train of treasured memories. But
the blow had never come quite this way before,
never fallen quite so near at home. An especially
dear friend had just been stricken less than a degree
of latitude away; but the poignancy of that
realisation was tempered by the thought that I was<!-- Page 102 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
in a ship rushing to her assistance, a ship that
could be as swift to succour as to avenge.</p>

<p>I must confess to a queerly mixed state of mind
that next half-hour. Consumed as I was with interest
in our terribly purposeful progress leading
up to the entrance into that grim drama approaching
its climacteric act just beyond the sky-line,
there were also vivid flare-backs of memory to the
days of my friendship with the <i>Marmora</i>, arresting
flashlights of the swift refreshing morning dive
into the canvas pool on her forecastle, of lounging
chairs ranged in long rows &rsquo;twixt snowy decks and
awnings, of a phosphorescent bow-wave curling
back and blotting the reflections of stars in a
tropical sea. There was a picture of the clean
sweet lines of her as&mdash;buff, black, and beautiful&mdash;she
lay at the north end of the horseshoe of the
Circular Quay at Sydney, with a rakish Messageries
liner moored astern of her and a bluff
Norddeutscher Lloyd packet ahead. It was her
maiden voyage, and Australia, which had never
seen so swift and luxurious a liner before, was receiving
her like a newly arrived <i>prima donna</i>. I
took passage in her back as far as Colombo. That
fortnight&rsquo;s voyage had been diverting in a number
of ways, I recalled, but most of all, perhaps, as a
consequence of the throwing together of a large
party of Wesleyan missionaries from Fiji and the
members of a London musical comedy company
returning from its Australian &ldquo;triumphs.&rdquo; I was<!-- Page 103 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
just beginning to chuckle inwardly at the recollection
of what one of the missionary ladies had said
to a buxom chorus-girl who tripped out to the
fancy dress cricket-match in her pink tights and a
ballet skirt, when the ting-a-ling of a bell brought
the captain to the radio-room voice-pipe. &ldquo;Message
just received,&rdquo; I heard him repeat. &ldquo;All right.
Send it up.&rdquo; He slapped down the voice-pipe cover,
and a messenger had handed him the signal before
he had paced twice across the bridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Marmora</i> just sunk,&rdquo; he read; &ldquo;survivors
picked up by P.B.&rsquo;s <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sinking made no immediate change in our
plans. There was still a chance we might be of use
with the survivors, and also the matter of the U-boat
to be looked after. With no abatement of
speed, all three destroyers drove on. The navigating
officer reckoned that in another fifteen minutes
we should be sighting the rescuing craft, and
probably wreckage; but when twice that time still
left a clear horizon ahead, it began to appear as
though there had been a mistake of some kind.
And so there had, but it was a lucky mistake for
us. It was some time later before they figured just
how it had chanced, but what had happened was
this. The <i>Marmora&rsquo;s</i> last despairing call&mdash;doubtless
sent out by a breaking-down radio&mdash;gave her
position as some ten or twelve miles out from what
it really was. The consequence was that, heading
somewhat wide of the sinking ship, to which, however,<!-- Page 104 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
on account of the presence of the patrol boats,
which had evidently been close enough to come to
her immediate assistance, we could have been of
small use, we had steered directly for the one point
where it was most desirable we should make our
appearance at that psychological moment: for the
point, in short, at which the coolly calculative
skipper of the U-boat responsible for the outrage,
after running submerged for an hour or more and
doubtless figuring he had come sufficiently far
from the madding crowd that would throng the
immediate vicinity of the wreckage to be at peace,
had come up to smoke his evening pipe and cogitate
upon the Freedom of the Seas.</p>

<p>It was just as it began to become apparent that
we were badly adrift as regards the point where
the <i>Marmora</i> had gone down that a whine from the
lookout&rsquo;s voice-pipe reported to the bridge that it
had sighted a &ldquo;sail&mdash;port, ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked back the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like subm&rsquo;rine,&rdquo; came the reply; and with
one quick movement the captain had started the
alarm-bell sounding &ldquo;General quarters!&rdquo; in every
part of the ship. With every man knowing precisely
what he had to do, and how to do it, there
was incredible speed without confusion. Tumbling
to their stations like hounds on a hot scent, they
yet managed to avoid getting in each other&rsquo;s way,
even in the narrow passages and on the ladders. The<!-- Page 105 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
loom of the conning-tower was plain to the naked
eye, now that one knew where to look for it, but
only for a few minutes. Even as a swiftly passed
shell was thrown into the open breech of the forecastle
gun, came the look-out&rsquo;s whine through the
voice-pipe, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going down, sir; she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;
The breech of the gun spun shut, but the eye of the
sightsetter groped along an empty horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; muttered the captain grimly.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have croaked him with one shot anyhow.
Got something better&rsquo;n shells for him. Now
for it,&rdquo; and his hand went back to pull the wire of
a gong which gave certain orders to the men standing-by
with the depth-charges. That, a word down
the engine-room voice-pipe, and a fraction of a
point&rsquo;s alteration in the course&mdash;and there was only
one thing left to be done. The time for that had
not quite arrived.</p>

<p>Because a destroyer&rsquo;s engine-room telegraph-hand
points to &ldquo;Full speed!&rdquo; it does not necessarily
mean that there are not ways of forcing more revolutions
from the engines, of driving her still faster
through the water should the need arise. Such a
need now confronted the <i>Zip</i>, and, like the thoroughbred
she was, her response was instant and
generous. The pulsing throb of her quickened till
it was almost a hum; the quivering insistency of it
struck straight to the marrow of the bones,
drummed in the depths of one&rsquo;s innermost being.<!-- Page 106 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
If there is anything to stir the blood of a man like
a destroyer beginning to see red and go Berserk,
I have yet to encounter it.</p>

<p>There must have been something like three miles
to go from the point where the U-boat had been
sighted to the point where the inevitable patch of
grease would mark the place where it had submerged,
and rather less than twice that many
minutes had elapsed when the cry of &ldquo;Oil slick&mdash;starboard
bow!&rdquo; came almost simultaneously from
the look-outs in the foretop and on the bridge.
Over went the helm a spoke or two, and the executive
officer, in his hand a thin piece of board with a
table of figures pasted on it, moved up beside the
captain. Straight down the wobbly track of iridescent
film drove the <i>Zip</i>, and when a certain length
of it had been put astern, the captain turned and
drew a lever to him with a sharp pull.</p>

<p>Three, four seconds passed, and then, simultaneously
with a heavy knocking thud, a round
patch of water a hundred yards or so astern quivered
and fizzed up sharply like the surface of a
glass of whisky-and-soda after the siphon has
ceased to play on it. Following that by a second or
two, a smooth rounded geyser of foam boiled up a
dozen feet or so, and then gradually subsided.
That one, plainly, was a deep-set charge, whose force
was expended far beneath the surface. A second
one threw a geyser twice as high as the first, and a
third, which fizzed and spouted almost simultaneously,<!-- Page 107 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
blotted out a great patch of sternward sky
with its smoke-shot eruption.</p>

<p>Presently the <i>Zop</i> &ldquo;struck oil,&rdquo; and then the <i>Zap</i>.
Soon the muffled booms of their rapidly scuttled
depth-charges began to drum, while astern of them
the foam-spouts nicked the sky-line like a stubby
picket fence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lad whom I later overheard describing
that bombardment by saying that &ldquo;&rsquo;tween
the three of us, we was scattering &lsquo;cans&rsquo; like rice
at a wedding&rdquo; was guilty of some exaggeration;
but it is a fact that they were spilling over very
fast and, there is little doubt, with telling effect.
The savageness of the bolts of wrath released by
the exploding charges was strikingly disclosed when
two of them chanced to be dropped at nearly the
same time by destroyers a mile or more apart, when
the under-sea &ldquo;jolts&rdquo; would meet half-way and
form weird evanescent &ldquo;rips&rdquo; of dancing froth
strongly suggestive of chain-lightning. The way in
which even the most distant of the detonations
made a destroyer &ldquo;bump the bumps,&rdquo; quite as
though it was striking a series of solid obstructions,
gave some hints of the bolts that were descending
upon the lurking pirate.</p>

<p>At the end of a minute or two a quick order from
the captain sent the wheel spinning over, and, with
raucous grinding of helm, round we swung through
sixteen points to head back in reverse over the path
of destruction we had just traversed. Just as the<!-- Page 108 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
steel runners of a racing skater throw ice when he
makes a sudden turn, so the screws of a speeding
destroyer hurl water. The stern sank deep into
the propeller-scooped void, so that the high-tossed
side-slipping wake buried it beneath a frothing
flood. Through several long seconds I saw the
water boiling above the waists of the men at the
depth-charges, without appearing to disturb them
in the least; then the wheel was spun back &rsquo;midships&mdash;and
a spoke or two beyond to meet and
steady her&mdash;the bow wave resumed its curled
symmetry and the wake began trailing off astern
again.</p>

<p>It was into a peaceful sea, indolently rolling,
sunset tinged and slightly sleeked with a thin
streak of oil, that we had raced five minutes before;
it was a troubled sea, charge-churned and wave-slashed,
that we now nosed back into to see what
good our coming had wrought. The grey-blue-black
of the long oil wake had been scattered into broken
patches by the explosions. Most of these were pale,
sickly, and highly an&aelig;mic in colour, and of scant
promise; but for one, where fresh oil rising spread
rainbow-bright upon the surface, the <i>Zip</i> headed
full tilt. The explosion here appeared to have been
an unusually heavy one, for the sea was dotted with
the white bellies of stunned fish, most of them floating
high out of the water, with trickles of blood
running from their upturned mouths and distended<!-- Page 109 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
gills. A six or eight-foot shark, wriggling drunkenly
along the surface with a broken back, was
hailed with a howl of delight by the men, who
claimed to see in the fact that the unlucky monster
could not submerge his telltale dorsal, a sign that
their Fritz might be in the same difficulty.</p>

<p>Another &ldquo;can&rdquo; or two was let go as we dashed
through that iridescent &ldquo;fount of promise&rdquo;; and
when we turned back to it again the wounded shark
had ceased to wriggle and now floated inertly
among his hapless brothers. But of Fritz&mdash;save
for a glad new gush of oil&mdash;no sign. Prisoners or
wreckage are rated as the only indubitable evidence
of the destruction of a U-boat, and neither of these
were we able to woo to the surface in that busy hour
which elapsed before the descending pall of darkness
put a period to our well-meant efforts. During
that time not the most delicate instrument devised
by science for that purpose revealed any
indication of life or movement in the depths below.
As the water at this point was far too deep to allow
a submarine to descend and lie on the bottom without
being crushed, this fact appeared morally conclusive.
It was this I had in mind when I tried to
draw the captain out on the subject. &ldquo;Of course
there&rsquo;s no doubt we bagged him?&rdquo; I hazarded, in
a quiet interval when we were watchfully waiting
for something to turn up, or rather come up. He
smiled a rather tired smile. &ldquo;Oh, very likely we<!-- Page 110 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
have,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But, unluckily, there&rsquo;s nothing
we can lay our hands on to carry away and
prove it. In case this particular Fritz doesn&rsquo;t come
to life and sink another ship in the course of the
next few days, there is just a chance that we may
be credited with a &lsquo;Possible.&rsquo; They never err on
the optimistic side in sizing up a little brush of
this kind, and perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well. Anyhow,
a game like this is worth playing on its own
account, whether you come in with a scalp at your
belt every time or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just as darkness was slowing down our
anti-U-boat operations, that a signal came through
stating that there were believed to be several survivors
still alive among the wreckage of the <i>Marmora</i>,
and ordering us to proceed to the scene of
her sinking with all dispatch. The moon was rising
as we began to nose among the pathetic litter
of scraps that was all that remained afloat of what,
five or six hours previously, had been a swift and
beautiful auxiliary cruiser.</p>

<p>There was enough light for us to be reasonably
sure, at the end of an hour&rsquo;s search, that our mission
was in vain; that there remained no living man
to pick up. There was something strangely
familiar, though, in the lines of a cutter which, in
spite of a smashed gunwale, was still afloat, and I
was just thinking of how grateful a lee, in the monsoon,
the windward side of the old <i>Marmora&rsquo;s</i> lifeboats
had furnished for a deck-chair or two, when<!-- Page 111 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the captain, advancing the handle of the engine-room
telegraph, turned to me with: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re off to
rendezvous with the <i>Lymptania</i> now; I think we
can promise you some real excitement in the course
of the next day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE CONVOY GAME</h3>


<p>The fantastic pile of multi-coloured slabs blotting
out a broken patch of sky above the seaward
end of the estuary, if it had been on
land, might have been anything from a row of
hangars, viewed in slant perspective, to the scaffolding
of a scenic railway, or a &ldquo;Goblin&rsquo;s Castle&rdquo; in
Luna Park. But there in the middle of the channel,
the mountainous bulk could only be one thing,
the <i>Lymptania</i>, the ship which our division of
American destroyers had been ordered to escort on
that part of its westbound voyage in which there
was reckoned to be danger of submarine attack.
Distorted by the camouflage, the tumbled mass of
jumbled colours continued to loom in jagged indefinitiveness
as we closed it from astern, and it
was only when we had come up well abreast of it
that the parts settled down into &ldquo;ship-shapeliness,&rdquo;
and the silhouette of perhaps the most
famous of the world&rsquo;s great steamers sharpened
against the sunlit afternoon clouds.</p>

<p>The change which had been wrought in the appearance
of the <i>Lymptania</i> since last I had seen
her was almost beyond belief. Then she had been<!-- Page 113 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
a hospital ship, with everything about her, from
snowy whiteness to red crosses in paint and coloured
lights, calculated to establish her character,
to give her the protection of conspicuousness. Now
she sought protection in quite the opposite way.
Every trick of scientific camouflage had been employed
to render her inconspicuous; while, if that
failed, there were the destroyers. The protection
of these big liners is a considerable undertaking,
but it has its redeeming features. As U-boat bait
they are unrivalled, and the number of German
submarines which have been sent to the bottom as
a direct consequence of attempting to sink one of
them will make a long and interesting list when the
time comes to publish it.</p>

<p>There was something almost awesome in the
emptiness of the great ship, in the lifelessness of
the decks, in the miles of blinded ports. The heads
of a few sailors &ldquo;snugging down&rdquo; on the forecastle,
a knot of officers at the end of the bridge,
and two stewardesses in white uniforms leaning
over the rail of one of the upper decks&mdash;that was all
there was visible of human life on a ship which a
few days before had been packed to the funnels
with its thousands of American soldiers. A lanky
destroyer gunner lounging by a ladder, described
her exactly when he said to one of his mates: &ldquo;Gee,
but ain&rsquo;t she the lonesome one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Zip</i> turned his glasses back
to cover the little group of officers on the liner&rsquo;s<!-- Page 114 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
bridge. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the skipper,&rdquo; he said presently.
&ldquo;I only hope he&rsquo;s well ahead of the game on the
sleeps, for I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting that he won&rsquo;t
be leaving that bridge for a cup of coffee for some
time. It&rsquo;s going to be an anxious interval for him&mdash;very
anxious. It&rsquo;s quite beyond calculation, the
value to the Allies at this moment of a ship of the
size and speed of the <i>Lymptania</i>, and her skipper
must know from what has happened the last week,
that the Huns are all out to bag her this time, and
he can hardly be able to extract any too much comfort
out of the fact that it&rsquo;s about a hundred to one
that we&rsquo;ll bag the Fritz that tries it&mdash;either before
or after the event. Yes, it will be an anxious time
for him&mdash;but,&rdquo; a grimly wry smile coming to his
face as he turned his eyes to the opening seaward
horizon, &ldquo;even so, it&rsquo;ll be nothing to the time we&rsquo;re
in for in the <i>Zip</i> and all the rest of the escort. <i>He&rsquo;ll</i>
be able to sleep if he happens to take a notion to;
<i>we</i> won&rsquo;t, at least, not during the time we&rsquo;ve got
<i>her</i> to shepherd. Again, he&rsquo;s only got the <i>chance</i>
of being hit by a torpedo to worry about; we&rsquo;ve
got the <i>certainty</i> of being hit by head-seas that have
as much kick in them to a driven destroyer as a
tin-fish full of gun-cotton. Unless the weather gets
either a good deal better or a shade worse, we&rsquo;re
sure up against the real thing this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; continued the captain, taking up
the slack in the hood of his weather-proof jacket as
a slight alteration of course brought a new slant<!-- Page 115 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of wind; &ldquo;the fact is, I&rsquo;d much rather see it get
worse than better. If it would only kick up enough
sea so that there was no chance of a submarine
operating in it, she could drive right along on her
own without any need of destroyers. But so long
as we&rsquo;ve this weather there&rsquo;s a possibility of a torpedo
running in, we&rsquo;ve got to hang on to the last
shiver, and there are two or three things which are
going to make &lsquo;hanging on&rsquo; this particular trip
just a few degrees worse than anything we&rsquo;ve
stacked up against before. This is about the way
things stand: The <i>Lymptania&rsquo;s</i> best protection is
her speed; but while she is just about the fastest
of the big ships, she is also just about the biggest
of the fast ships. This means that the size of the
target she presents goes a long way toward offsetting
the advantage of her speed; so that the
presence of destroyers&mdash;in any kind of weather a
submarine can work in&mdash;is very desirable, and may
be vital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the escorting of any steamer that makes
over twenty knots an hour is a lively piece of business,
no matter what the weather, for destroyers,
to screen most effectively, should zigzag a good
deal more sharply than their convoy, and that, of
course, calls for several knots more speed. This
can be managed all right in fair weather, or even
in rough, where there is only a following or a beam
sea; but where the seas come banging down from
more than a point or two for&rsquo;ard of the beam it is<!-- Page 116 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
quite a different matter. In that event, the speed
of the whole procession depends entirely on how
much the destroyers can stand without being reduced
to scrap-iron. Naturally, the ship under
escort endeavours to make her speed conform to the
best the destroyers can do under the circumstances;
but since an extra knot or two an hour might well
make all the difference in avoiding a submarine
attack, the tendency always is to keep the escorting
craft extended to just about their limit of endurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just how the mean will be struck between what
a fast steamer thinks its escorting destroyers <i>ought</i>
to stand, and what the destroyers really <i>can</i> stand,
depends upon several things. Perhaps the principal
factor is the state of mind of the skipper of
the steamer, and that, in turn, is influenced by the
value of his ship&mdash;both actual and potential&mdash;and
the danger of submarine attack at that particular
time in the waters under traverse. When the destroyers
set out to escort a very fast and valuable
ship, steering into heavy head seas in waters where
there are known to be a number of U-boats operating,
they&rsquo;ve got the whole combination working
against them, and the result is&mdash;just what you&rsquo;re
slated to see this trip. Best take a good look at the
<i>Zip</i> while you&rsquo;ve got a chance; she may be quite a
bit altered by the time we get back to port again.
And you might take a squint at the <i>Flossie</i> over
there, too. She&rsquo;s our latest and swiftest, the<!-- Page 117 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Fotilla&rsquo;s pride. But this is her first experience of
taking out an ex-ocean greyhound, and if, in a
burst of fresh enthusiasm, she chances to tap any
of these several extra knots of speed she is supposed
to have&mdash;well, the <i>Flossie&rsquo;s</i> sky-line in that
case will be modified more than those of all the
rest of her older and wiser sisters put together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those were prophetic words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one thing that makes it certain that we&rsquo;ll
be put to the limit to-night,&rdquo; resumed the captain,
after he had rung up more speed on our coming out
into opener water, &ldquo;is the news in this morning&rsquo;s
official announcement of the sinking of the <i>Justicia</i>.
We seem just to have struck the peak of the midsummer
U-boat campaign. It was scarcely a week
ago that they got the <i>Carpathian</i>. Then, a few
days later, came the <i>Marmora</i> (you won&rsquo;t forget
for a while the strafe we had at the U-boat which
put her down), and now it&rsquo;s the <i>Justicia</i>, the biggest
ship they&rsquo;ve sunk in a year or so. That&rsquo;s the
thing that must be worrying the skipper of the
<i>Lymptania</i>, for it shows they&rsquo;re after the great
troop-carriers. The way they stuck to the <i>Justicia</i>
proves they&rsquo;re not yet beyond taking some risk if
the stake is high enough. Now and then some
Fritz is found desperate enough to commit hari-kari
by coming up close (if the chance offers) and
making sure of getting his torpedo home. He gets
what&rsquo;s coming to him, of course, but there is also
a fair chance of his getting the ship he is after; and<!-- Page 118 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a fast liner for a U-boat is a poor exchange&mdash;from
our standpoint. Naturally, these things all make
the skipper of the <i>Lymptania</i> anxious to minimise
his risks by hitting up just as hot a pace as he can,
and that, with her size and her power, will be just
about full speed. I can&rsquo;t tell you to a knot how fast
that is, but I can tell you this: if you were on the
bridge of a destroyer going at that speed when it
hit a good heavy head-sea, the only thing that would
tell you it wasn&rsquo;t a brick wall she had collided with
would be the sort of moist feeling about the pile-driver
that knocked you over the side. So it looks
like the rub is going to come in getting the <i>Lymptania</i>
to content herself with a speed at which&mdash;well,
at which you can detect some slight difference
between a head-sea and a brick wall from the bridge
of the destroyer doing the butting. Whatever that
proves to be, you&rsquo;ll have such a chance as you may
never get again to see what stuff your Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
destroyers are made of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We made screening formation as soon as we were
well clear of the barraged waters of the estuary,
though the sea we had to traverse before entering
the open Atlantic was considered practically
empty of menace. The <i>Lymptania</i>, making astonishingly
little smoke for a coal-burner, worked up
to somewhere near her top speed in a very short
time; but, with the light-running seas well abaft
the beam, the destroyers cut their zigzags round
and about her with many knots in reserve. The big<!-- Page 119 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
liner, with much experience to her credit, knew
precisely what to do and how to do it, and the
whole machine of the convoy worked as though
pulled by a single string. Her very movements
themselves seemed to give the various units of the
escort their cues, for, though she steered a course
so devious and irregular that no submarine could
have possibly told how to head in order to waylay
her, she was never &ldquo;uncovered.&rdquo; Ahead and
abreast of her, going their own way individually,
but still conforming their general movements to
hers, the destroyers wove their practically impenetrable
screen.</p>

<p>Whatever there was ahead, it was ideal destroyer
weather for the moment, and all hands came
swarming out on the dry sun-warmed deck to make
the most of it while it lasted. An importunate
whine from a nest of arms and legs sprawling
abreast the midships torpedo-tubes attracted my
attention for a moment as I sauntered aft to see
what was afoot, and presently the rattle of dice on
the deck and an imploring &ldquo;Come on, you Seven!&rdquo;
told me they were &ldquo;shooting Craps,&rdquo; with, I
shortly discovered, bars of milk chocolate and
sticks of chewing-gum for stakes. Several others
were playing &ldquo;High, Low, Jack,&rdquo; and here and
there&mdash;using elbows and knees to keep the bellying
pages from blowing away&mdash;were little knots clustered
about the latest Sunday Supplement from
New York.<!-- Page 120 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>But quite the best thing of all was two brown-armed
youngsters going through a proper battery
warming-up with a real baseball. I had seen enthusiasts
on two or three of the American units with
the Grand Fleet playing catch right up to the
moment &ldquo;General Quarters&rdquo; was sounded for target
practice; but that was on the broad decks of
battleships, with some chance of saving a ball that
chanced to be muffed. But here the pitcher had to
wind-up with a sort of a corkscrew stoop to keep
from hitting his hand against a stay, while the
catcher braced himself with one foot against a
depth-charge and the other against the mounting
of the after-gun. There were four or five things
that the ball had to clear by less than a foot in its
flight from one to the other, but the only ones of
these I recall now are a searchlight diaphragm and
a gong which sounded from the bridge a standby
signal to the men at the depth-charges. I actually
saw that skilfully directed spheroid make two complete
round-trips, from the pitcher to the catcher
and back, before it struck the gong a resonant bing!
caromed against the side of an out-slung boat and
disappeared into the froth of the wake.</p>

<p>The pitcher and catcher were in a hot argument
as to whether that was the twenty-sixth or the
twenty-seventh ball they had lost overboard since
the first of the month, but they fell quiet and
turned sympathetic ears to my description of a net<!-- Page 121 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
I had seen rigged on one of the American battleships
to prevent that very trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nifty enough,&rdquo; was the pitcher&rsquo;s comment when
I had finished describing how the net was drawn
taut right under the stern to prevent all leakage.
&ldquo;Only thing is, the captain might rule it off on the
score that it&rsquo;d catch the &lsquo;cans&rsquo; we was trying to
drop on Fritz as well as the &lsquo;wild pitches.&rsquo; Might
do for harbour use, though. Lost balls is a considerable
drain even there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just before dinner-time that the lengthening
life of the seas gave warning that we were coming
out into the Atlantic. The force of them was
still abaft the beam, however, and their principal
effect was to add a few degrees of roll, with an
occasional deluge dashing in admonitory flood
across the decks. But it was enough to make the
Ward Room untenable, so that dinner had to be
wolfed propped up on the transoms, one nicely balanced
dish at a time. There would be about an
hour more of this comparative comfort, the captain
said, before we reached a position where the full
force of the seas would be felt, but things would not
really &ldquo;begin to drop&rdquo; till the <i>Lymptania</i> altered
course and headed westerly. &ldquo;If you have any
writing, reading, sleeping, or anything except just
existing to do,&rdquo; he warned, as he kept his soup from
overflowing by an undulant gesture of the hand
which poised it, &ldquo;better do it now. It&rsquo;s your last
chance.&rdquo;<!-- Page 122 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The forty winks I managed to snatch as a result
of following up the sleeping part of that recommendation
stood me in good stead in the times
ahead. It took no little composing to doze off even
as it was, and it was the sharp bang my head got
from the siderail of my bunk that put a period to
the nap I did get. The rolling had increased enormously,
and though it was apparent we were not yet
bucking into it, the swishing of the water on the
forecastle overhead indicated that there had been
enough alteration of course to bring the seas&mdash;on
one leg of the zigzags at least&mdash;well forward of the
beam. I climbed out, pulled on my weather-proof
suit and sea-boots, and clambered up to the bridge.</p>

<p>There were still a couple of hours to go before
dark, and in the diffused light of a bright bank of
sunset clouds the gay dazzle colours of all the ships
showed up brilliantly as they ploughed the whitecap-plumed
surface of a sea which now stretched
unbrokenly to the westward horizon. There was a
world of power behind the belligerent bulk of swells
which had been gathering force under the urge of a
west-nor&rsquo;-west wind that had chased them all the
way from Labrador, and the destroyers, teetering
quarteringly along their foam-crested tops, were
rolling drunkenly and yawing viciously ahead of
jagged wakes.</p>

<p>Still driving on at express speed, however, they
continued to maintain perfect formation on the
swiftly steaming <i>Lymptania</i>. The latter, apparently<!-- Page 123 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
as steady as though &ldquo;chocked up&rdquo; in a dry-dock,
drove serenely on in great swinging
zigzags.</p>

<p>The captain came up from the chart-room and
took a long look around. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just about as I expected,&rdquo;
he said, shaking his head dubiously. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t so rough but what a submarine might stage an
attack if her skipper had the nerve; and it&rsquo;s a darn
sight too rough for destroyers to screen the <i>Lymptania</i>
with her holding to anything like full speed.
It&rsquo;s all up now to <i>what</i> speed she will try to hold
us to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter with this?&rdquo; I protested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still hitting the high places for speed, and,
while I wouldn&rsquo;t call this exactly comfortable, we
still seem to be making pretty good weather of it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <a name="LINER" id="LINER"><img src="images/illo05.jpg"

     height="341" width="600"  /></a>
</div>
<h4>WHERE THE GREAT LINER PLOWED ALONG</h4>

<p>The captain smiled indulgently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;as far as you go. We are indeed hitting
the high places, but&mdash;the high places haven&rsquo;t
started hitting us yet. Wait just about five or ten
minutes,&rdquo; he added, turning his glasses to where
the great liner, silhouetted for the moment against
the sunset clouds, ploughed along on our port beam,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see the difference. Ah!&rdquo; this as he
steadied his glasses on where the boiling wake of
the <i>Lymptania</i>, beginning to bend away in a sharp
curve indicating a considerable alteration of course.
&ldquo;There she goes now. Hold tight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his hand on the engine-room telegraph, the
captain gave the men at the wheel a course to conform<!-- Page 124 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to that of the <i>Lymptania</i>. Quick as a cat on
her helm, the <i>Zip</i> swung swiftly through eight
points and plunged ahead. This brought on her
bows seas that had been rolling up abeam, and we
were up against the real thing at last.</p>

<p>The first sea, which she caught while she was
still turning, the <i>Zip</i> contented herself with slicing
off the truculently-tossing top of before crunching
it underfoot. It was a smartly-executed performance,
and seemed to promise encouragingly as to
the way she might be expected to dispose of the
next ones. The second in line, however, which she
met head-on and essayed the same tactics with,
dampened her ardour&mdash;and just about everything
and everybody else below the foretop&mdash;by detaching
a few tons of its bumptious bulk and raking her
fore-and-aft with its rumbling green-white flood.
The bridge was above the main weight of that blow,
but &rsquo;midships and aft I saw men bracing themselves
against a knee-deep stream. One bareheaded
and bare-armed man, who had evidently been surprised
in making his way from one hatch to
another, I saw rolled fifteen or twenty feet and
slammed up against the torpedo-tube which prevented
his going overboard. He limped out of
sight, rubbing his shoulder, and probably never
knew how lucky he was in being caught by <i>that</i>
wave instead of one which came along a minute
later.</p>

<p>The slams which she received from the next two<!-- Page 125 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
or three seas left the <i>Zip</i> in a somewhat chastened
mood, and rather less sanguine respecting her
ability to go on pulling off that little stunt of surmounting
waves by biting them in the neck and
then trampling their bodies under foot. She was
beginning to realise that she had a body of her
own, and that there was something else around that
could bite&mdash;yes, and kick, and gouge, and punch
below the belt, and do all the other low-down tricks
of the underhand fighter.</p>

<p>Languid and uncertain of movement, like a dazed
prize-fighter, she was just steadying herself from
the jolt a bustling brute of a comber had dealt her
in passing, when the skyline ahead was blotted out
by the imminent green-black loom of a running wall
of water which, from its height and steepness,
might well have been kicked up by a Valparaiso
&ldquo;Norther&rdquo; or a South Sea hurricane.</p>

<p>It may have been the chastened state of mind the
last sea had left her in which was responsible for
<i>Zip&rsquo;s</i> deciding to take this one &ldquo;lying down&rdquo;; or
again, it may be that she was acting, in reverse,
after the example set by the rabbit who, because he
couldn&rsquo;t go under the hill, went over it. At any
rate, after one shuddering look at the mountainous
menace tottering above her bows, she made up her
mind that she was better off under the sea than on
the surface, and deliberately dived. Of course, it
was the Parthian kick the last sea had given her
stern that was really responsible for her bows<!-- Page 126 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
starting to go down at the very instant those of
every other ship that one had had experience of
would have been beginning to point skyward, but
to all intents and purposes she looked, from the
bridge, to be submerging of her own free and considered
decision. The principal thing which
differentiated it from the ordinary dive of a submarine
was the fact that it was made at a sharper
angle and at about four times the speed.</p>

<p>There was something almost uncanny in the
quietness with which that plunge began; though, on
the latter score, there was nothing to complain of
by about half a second later. I have seen at one
time or another almost every conceivable kind of
craft, from a Fijian war canoe to the latest battlecruiser,
trying to buck head seas, and invariably
the wave that swept it had the decency to announce
its coming by a warning knock on the
bows. This time there was nothing of the kind.
The retreating sea had lifted her stern so high that
the forecastle was under water even before the coming
one had begun to topple over on to it. The
consequence was that there was no preliminary
bang to herald the onrush of the latter.</p>

   height="323" width="600"  /></a>
</div>
<h4>WE HAD COLLIDED WITH THE &ldquo;BRICK WALL&rdquo;</h4>

<p>The base of the mountainous roller simply
flooded up over the diving forecastle and crashed
with unbroken force against the bridge. We had
collided with the &ldquo;brick wall&rdquo; right enough, and
for the next few seconds at least the result was
primal chaos.<!-- Page 127 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a vivid but detached recollection of two
or three things in the instant that the blow impended.
One is of the helmsman, crouching low,
with legs wide apart, locking his arms through the
slender steel spokes of the wheel the better to
steady her in the coming smash. Another is of the
captain, with hunched shoulders and set jaw, throwing
over the telegraph to stop the engines. But
the clearest picture of all is of the submarine lookout
on the port side&mdash;a black-eyed, black-haired boy
with a profile that might have been copied from an
old Roman coin&mdash;who was leaning out and grinning
sardonically into the very teeth of the descending
hydraulic ram. It was his savagely-flung anatomy,
I believe, though I never made sure, which bumped
me in the region of the solar plexus a moment later
and broke my slipping hold on the buckling stanchion
to which I was trying to cling.</p>

<p>There was nothing whatever suggestive of water&mdash;soft,
fluent, trickling water&mdash;in the first shattering
impact of that mighty blow. It was as solid
as a collision between ship and ship; indeed, the
recollection I have of a railway wreck I was once
in on a line in the Argentine Pampas is of a shock
less shattering. It is difficult to record events in
their proper sequence, partly because they were all
happening at once, and partly because the self-centred
frame of mind I was in at the moment was
not favourable for detached observation. The
noise and the jar of the crash were stupendous, yet<!-- Page 128 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
neither of these has left so vivid a mental impression
as the uncanny writhing of the two-inches-thick
steel stanchion to which I was endeavouring
to hold, and the nerve-racking sound of rending
metal. I have no recollection of hearing the clink
of broken glass, nor of being struck by pieces of
it; yet all the panes of heavy plate which screened
the forward end of the bridge&mdash;of a thickness, one
had supposed, to withstand anything likely to assail
them&mdash;were swept away as though they had been no
more than the rice-paper squares of a Japanese
window.</p>

<p>The rush of water, of course, followed instantly
upon the crash, yet, so vivid are my impressions of
the things intimately connected with the blow itself
that it seems as though there was an appreciable
interval between the fall of that and the time when
the enveloping cataclysm transformed the universe
into a green-white stream of brine. From ahead,
above and from both sides the flood poured, to meet
and mingle in a whirling maelstrom in the middle
of the bridge. There was nothing of blown spindrift
to it; it was green and solid and flowed with a
heave and a hurl that made no more of slamming a
man to the deck than of tossing a life-buoy. I went
the whole length of the bridge when I lost my grip
on the port stanchion, brought up against the after-rail,
and then went down into a tangle of signal
flags. I remember distinctly, though, that the walls
of water rushing by completely blotted out sea and
sky to port and starboard, and that there was all<!-- Page 129 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the darkness of late twilight in the cavern of the
engulfed bridge. Then the great sea tumbled aft
along the main deck, and it grew light again.</p>

<p>The captain and the helmsman had both kept
their feet, and the latter, dripping from head to
heel, was just throwing over the engine-room telegraph
as I shook off my mantle of coloured bunting
and crawled back to my moorings at the stanchion.
Immediately afterwards I saw him jump on to the
after-rail and make some sort of negative signal to
a couple of half-drowned boys who, waist-deep in
swirling water, were pawing desperately among the
depth-charges. Then he came over and joined me
for a few moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some sea, that,&rdquo; he said, slipping down his
hood and throwing back the brine-dripping hair
from his forehead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened before, but
never like that. Lord only knows what it&rsquo;s done to
her. S&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ll begin to hear of that in a minute.&rdquo;
He pointed to a string of porcelain insulators
dangling at the end of twisted bits of wire in front
of one of the paneless windows. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the remains
of our auxiliary radio,&rdquo; he said, grinning;
&ldquo;and look at the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle. Swept clean, pretty near.
Thank heaven, the gun&rsquo;s left. But, do you remember
that heavy iron bar the muzzle rested on?
Gone! It was probably that, with some of the
shells in the rack, that made all that rat-a-tat. But
what of it? Look how she rides &rsquo;em now that she&rsquo;s<!-- Page 130 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
eased down a bit. Only trouble is, she&rsquo;s got to go
it again. Look how we&rsquo;ve dropped back.&rdquo; And
he gave the engine-room, by voice-pipe, a new
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; speed, and threw the telegraph over
to &ldquo;Full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pulsing throb began anew, and under the
urge of speeding propellers the <i>Zip</i>, steering in narrowed
zig-zags quickly regained her station. All of
the destroyers, and the <i>Lymptania</i> as well, had
eased down slightly, and the reduced speed meant
also a reduction of the danger of another of those
deep-sea dives, something no craft but a submarine
is built to stand the strain of. But even as it was
we were driving right up to the limit of endurance
all the time, and the sea that did not come rolling
up green right over the bows was the exception
rather than the rule. From the forecastle right
away aft there was never more than a few seconds
at a time when the main deck was free of rollicking
cascades of boiling brine, and there were moments
when only the funnels and the after superstructure,
rearing up like isolated rocks on a storm-beaten
coast, were visible above the swirling flood. There
were times when the men standing-by at the guns
and torpedo-tubes seemed almost to be engulfed;
yet none of them was swept away, and they even&mdash;from
the way they kept joking each other in the
lulls&mdash;appeared to be getting a good deal of sport
out of the thing.</p>

<p>The barometer was falling, and both wind and<!-- Page 131 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
waves gained steadily in force as the afternoon
lengthened and merged into a twilight that was
itself already melting before the rising moon.
Clouds were few and scattering, and it was plain
there were to be no hours dark enough to offer any
protection from submarine attack. Looming as
large as ever, the big liner offered scarcely a better
target on the side she was illuminated by the moonlight
than on the one from which she was silhouetted
against it. From either side a fifth of a mile
of steel would &ldquo;take a lot of missing,&rdquo; and her
captain, sensibly enough, would not ease his engines
by a revolution more than was necessary to
keep within his destroyer screen. It was plainly
up to the destroyers to stick it to the limit, and
that is just what they did. As I heard one of the
men put it, it was the &ldquo;bruisiest&rdquo; bit of escort-work
they had ever been&mdash;or probably ever will be&mdash;called
upon to face, but every one of those Yankee
destroyers stayed with it to the finish.</p>

<p>Now it would be the <i>Zop</i> that would emerge
from under a mountainous sea and come drifting
back without steerage weigh, rolling drunkenly in
the trough, and now it would be the <i>Zap</i>. And
now this or that result of a &ldquo;hydraulic ramming&rdquo;
would disable one of the others temporarily. But,
game to the last flake of brine-frosted camouflage,
back they came to it again, and again, and yet
again. Sunrise of the next day found them plugging
on in station, and in station they remained<!-- Page 132 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
until the <i>Lymptania</i>, beyond the zone of all possible
submarine danger, made a general signal of
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and headed off to the westward on
her own.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Out of the dim grey dawn of the morning after
the night before, battered and buckled, but still unbroken,
the wearily waggling line of the <i>Lymptania&rsquo;s</i>
late escort trailed back into harbour. The
mussed-up silhouette of every one of them bore
mute testimony to the way she had been put
&ldquo;through the mill,&rdquo; and, in most cases, the things
that met the eye were not the worst. The <i>Zop</i>
needed every yard of the channel as she zig-zagged
up it under a jury steering-gear, and the <i>Zap</i>, like
a man dazed from a blow, would have sudden
&ldquo;mental hiati&rdquo; in which she would straggle carelessly
out of line with an inconsequential going-to-pick-flowers-by-the-roadside
sort of air. The <i>Zim&rsquo;s</i>
idiosyncrasies had more of an epileptic suddenness
about them, and her hectic coughing plainly indicated
some kind of &ldquo;lung trouble.&rdquo; Our little
<i>Zip</i> presented a very brave front to the outer world,
but I heard hollow clankings punctuating the erstwhile
even hum of the engines, while the drip, drip,
drip and the drop, drop, drop through the crinkled
sheet-steel sheathing of my cabin told that the deck-plates
of the forecastle fitted a good deal less
snugly than before they had played anvil to the
lusty head-sea hammer.<!-- Page 133 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>But the <i>Flossie</i>, the &ldquo;latest, the swiftest, the
flotilla&rsquo;s pride&rdquo;&mdash;the wounds of all the rest of us
put together were as nothing to those of the <i>Flossie</i>.
In trying to maintain her pride of place at the
head of the escort, she <i>had</i>, for a brief space, unleashed
those extra knots of speed the captain had
spoken of, and all that, and even more than, he
had prophesied had come to pass. It was just such
a swaggerer of a sea as that first one that <i>Zip</i> had
dived into which did the trick, only, as the <i>Flossie</i>
was going faster, the impact was somewhat more
severe. She was a mile or more distant from us
when it happened, and, watching from the bridge
of the <i>Zip</i>, we simply saw her dissolve into a sky-tossed
spout of foam. When she reappeared she
was floating, beam-on, to the seas, and, for the
moment, an apparently helpless hulk.</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s instant diagnosis of a couple of
muffled detonations which followed was entirely
correct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sea must have &lsquo;jack-knifed&rsquo; the <i>Flossie</i> so
sharply,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the recoil took up the
slack in the wires, releasing two &lsquo;cans&rsquo; she seems
to have had set and ready. It&rsquo;s about the same
thing as just happened to us, except that the tautened
wire only rang the stand-by bell, the signal
for the men to set the depth-charges. First thing
I did after we came to the surface was to negative
that supposed order. That was what I was doing
when I waved to those boys who were clawing at<!-- Page 134 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the &lsquo;cans,&rsquo; with their heads under water. Lucky
they weren&rsquo;t carried away.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<h4>NOW SHE WAS BACK AT BASE</h4>

<p>It was a chastened <i>Flossie</i> which had gone
floundering back to station a few minutes later, but
somehow or other she had managed to carry on, and
now she was back at Base. I won&rsquo;t &ldquo;give comfort
to the enemy&rdquo; by trying to describe her appearance,
but some hint of it may be gleaned from the
laconic comment of one of the <i>Zip&rsquo;s</i> signalmen, as
the &ldquo;Flotilla&rsquo;s Pride&rdquo; was warping in to moor
alongside the mother ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;See the old <i>Vindictive</i>
limpin&rsquo; home from Zeebruggy! S&rsquo;pose
they&rsquo;ll fill her up with concrete now an&rsquo; block a
channel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain grinned as he overheard the remark
where he waited by the starboard rail for the last
of the mooring lines to be made fast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
quite so bad as that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If need be, they&rsquo;ll
have her, and all the rest of us, right as trivets in
three or four days, and quite ready to take the sea
again when our turn comes. It&rsquo;s all in the convoy
game, anyhow, and not such bad fun after all,
&rsquo;specially when it&rsquo;s behind you, and you&rsquo;ve got a
bath, and a change, and a lunch at the Club, and
an afternoon of tennis in immediate prospect.
Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>YANK BOAT <i>versus</i> U-BOAT</h3>


<p>It was the turn of the tide and the turn of the
day on the &ldquo;quiet waters of the River Lee.&rdquo;
Pale blue columns of smoke rose above the
verdant boskiness which masked the squat brown
cabins where the peat fires smouldered, and along
the straggling stone wall which crowned the ridge
the swaying heads of home-returning cows showed
intermittently against the glowing western sky.
The peacefulness of it was almost palpable. You
seemed to breathe it, and could all but reach out
with the hand and touch it.</p>

<p>It permeated even to the long lines of lean destroyers
in the stream, and it was the subtly suggestive
influence of it which had deflected homeward
the minds of the motley-clad sailors who were
lounging at ease about the stern of the first of a
&ldquo;cluster&rdquo; of three of these&mdash;like a sheaf of bright
multi-coloured arrows the trim craft looked, with
the level rays of the setting sun striking across
them where they lay moored alongside each other&mdash;and
set tongues wagging of the little things which,
magnified by distance, loom large in the imaginations
of men in exile.<!-- Page 136 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>They were deep in the &ldquo;old home town&rdquo; stuff
when I sauntered inconsequently aft on the off-chance
of picking up a yarn or two, but as there appeared
to be no one present from my part of the
country, no immediate opportunity to break in
presented itself. Equally an outsider was I when
the flow of discussion turned to woollen sweaters
and socks and mufflers, and the golden trails of
romance leading back from the names and messages
sewed or knitted into them.</p>

<p>No fair unknowns had ever sent <i>me</i> any of these
soft comforts, and after I had heard a lusty youngster
from Virginia tell how a &ldquo;sweater address&rdquo; he
had written what he described as a &ldquo;lettah that was
good and plenty w&rsquo;am, b&rsquo;lieve me,&rdquo; replied that she
was &ldquo;jest goin&rsquo; twelve years,&rdquo; and that her mother
didn&rsquo;t think she ought to be thinking of marriage
just yet&mdash;after that I didn&rsquo;t feel quite so bad over
not having had a chance to open one of these
&ldquo;woolly&rdquo; correspondences. There was some
solace, too, in hearing a pink-cheeked young ex-bank
clerk tell how the &ldquo;abdominal bandage&rdquo;
(they name them, as a rule, after the garment that
starts the correspondence), with whom he had exchanged
something like a dozen letters of cumulative
passion, brought the affair to a sudden and
violent end by some indirect and inadvertent
admission which showed that she remembered when
Grant was President.</p>

<p>But when the talk drifted, as it always does in<!-- Page 137 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the end, to baseball and baseballers, I knew that
there was going to be an opening for me presently,
and stood by to take advantage of it. A three-year
absentee from the bleachers, I was not sufficiently
up on last season&rsquo;s pennant race &ldquo;dope&rdquo; to
do more than make frequent sapient observations
on this or that big-leaguer&rsquo;s stickwork or
fielding as he was mentioned; but when they began
to discuss, or rather to wrangle over, for discuss is
far too polite a term, the theory of the game and to
grow red in the face over such esoterics (or &ldquo;inside
stuff,&rdquo; to put it in &ldquo;Fanese&rdquo;) as how and when
a &ldquo;squeeze&rdquo; ought to be pulled off, I showed them
the bulbous first joint of the little finger of my
right hand&mdash;which there is no other way of acquiring
than by the repeated telescopings of many
seasons on the diamond&mdash;and was welcomed at last
on equal terms. A seat was offered me on a depth-charge,
across the business end of which an empty
sack had been thrown to prevent a repetition of
what came near happening the time a stoker, who
was proving that Hans Wagner could never again
be a popular idol now that we were at war with the
Huns, punctuated his argument by hammering with
a monkey-wrench on the firing mechanism.</p>

<p>They were not as impressed as they should have
been when I told them that I learned the game
under the tutelage of the mighty Bill Lange (this,
of course, because the incomparable &ldquo;Big Bill&rdquo;
was at his zenith long before their time); but they<!-- Page 138 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
were duly respectful when I said I had played
three years&rsquo; Varsity baseball, and became quite
deferential when I assured them I had also survived
a season of bush-league in the North-West. There
was some kind of electrician rating in the crowd
who had been a bush-league twirler before his
&ldquo;wing went glass,&rdquo; as he put it, and he, it soon
transpired, had played in one place or another with
a number of my old team mates of the Montana
League. Deep in reminiscence of those good old
days, I quite forgot my subtle scheme of using baseball
as a stalking-horse for destroyer yarns, when
the arrival of some callers from a British sloop
lying a mile or two farther down the harbour recalled
it to me. They had been in the <i>Moonflower</i>,
the man next me said, when she put a U-boat out
of business not long before, and one of them&mdash;he
had some sort of decoration for his part in the
show&mdash;spun a cracking good yarn about it if you
got him started. This latter I managed to do by
asking him how it chanced that the <i>Moonflower</i>
was allowed to sport a star on her funnel. The
story he told, the while he rolled cigarettes and
worked his jaws on Yankee chewing-gum, revealed
rather too much that may be used in some future
surprise party to make it possible to publish just
yet, but it had the desired effect of turning the current
of reminiscence U-boatward. That was what
I wanted, for, now that men from several other destroyers
had come aboard and sauntered aft to join<!-- Page 139 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the party, the opportunity for finding out at firsthand
just what the American sailors thought of
the anti-submarine game at the end of a year and a
half of it was too good to be missed.</p>

<p>There was a considerable variety of opinions expressed
in that last hour of the second dog-watch
on the intricate inside stuff of the anti-U-boat game,
just as there had been about baseball, but there was
one point on which they were practically agreed:
that Fritz, especially during the last six months,
was not giving them a proper run for their money.
This is the way one of them, a bronzed seaman
gunner, with the long gorilla-like arms of a Sam
Langford, and gnarled knots of protuberant
muscles at the angles of his jaws, epitomized it:
&ldquo;We sees Fritzie, or we don&rsquo;t. Mostly we don&rsquo;t,
for he ducks under when he pipes our smoke. If
he&rsquo;s stalkin&rsquo; a convoy there&rsquo;s jest a chance of him
givin&rsquo; us time for a rangin&rsquo; shot at him on the surface.
Then we waltzes over to his grease and scatters
a bunch of &lsquo;cans&rsquo; round his restin&rsquo;-place. An&rsquo;
if the luck&rsquo;s with us, we gets him; an&rsquo; if the luck&rsquo;s
with him, we don&rsquo;t. If we crack open his shell,
down he goes; if we jest start him leakin&rsquo;, up he
comes. Only dif&rsquo;rence is that, in one case, it&rsquo;s all
hands down, and in t&rsquo;other, all hands up&mdash;&lsquo;Kamerad!&rsquo;
In both cases, no fight, no run for
our money. Now when we first come over, an&rsquo; &rsquo;fore
we&rsquo;d put the fear o&rsquo; God into Fritzie&rsquo;s heart, he
wasn&rsquo;t above takin&rsquo; a chance at a come-back now an&rsquo;<!-- Page 140 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
again. <i>Then</i> there was occas&rsquo;nal moments of
ple&rsquo;surabl&rsquo; excitement, like the time when&rdquo;&mdash;and
he went on to tell of how an enterprising U-boat
commander slipped a slug into the <i>Courser</i> abreast
her after superstructure, and &ldquo;beat it&rdquo; off before
that stricken destroyer had a chance to retaliate.
Only the fact that, by a miracle, the torpedo failed
to detonate her depth-charges saved the <i>Courser</i>
from destruction, and even as it was, rare seamanship
had been required to take her back to port.
And he also told of the unlucky <i>John Hawkins</i>,
which a U-boat had actually put down, and the
grim situation which confronted the sailors when
they found themselves sinking in a ship which
carried a number of depth-charges set on the
&ldquo;ready.&rdquo; But all that, he said, with the air of an
old man speaking of his departed youth, was before
they had begun to learn Fritzie&rsquo;s little ways,
and before Fritz, perhaps as a consequence, had
begun to lose his nerve. Now, far from being willing
to put up a fight with a destroyer, it was only
&ldquo;once in a blue moon that he&rsquo;s got the guts to put
up a scrap even to save his own hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A slender fair-haired lad, with a quick observant
eye which revealed him as a signalman even before
one looked at his sleeve, cut in sharply at this
juncture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there must have been a blue moon shedding
its light over these waters last month,&rdquo; he
said decisively. &ldquo;I quite agree with you that<!-- Page 141 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Fritz hasn't got the nerve&mdash;or it may be because
he&rsquo;s got too much sense&mdash;to take a chance at a destroyer
any more. But in the matter of putting up
a fight for his life&mdash;yes, even for giving a real run
for the money&mdash;well, all I can say is that if you&rsquo;d
been out on the <i>Sherill</i> about three weeks ago, you
wouldn&rsquo;t be making that complaint about one
particular Fritz at least. If going eighteen hours,
with two or three destroyers and a sloop or two
doing everything they know how to crack in his
shell all the time, without chucking his hand in,
and very likely getting clear in the end&mdash;if that
isn&rsquo;t putting up a fight for life and giving a run
for the money, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had heard this astonishing &ldquo;battle of wakes
and wits,&rdquo; as someone had christened it, referred
to on several occasions, but had never had the
chance to hear any of the details from one who had
had anything like the opportunities always open
to a signalman to follow what is going on. &ldquo;Most
of the bunch have heard all they want to hear of it
already,&rdquo; the lad replied with a laugh when I
asked him to tell me the story; &ldquo;and, besides, a
more or less long-winded yarn of the kind I suppose
you want would tire &rsquo;em to tears anyway. If you
really want to hear something of it, come over to
the <i>Sherill</i> (that&rsquo;s her stern there, just beyond the
<i>Flossie</i>) any time after eight bells. I go on watch
then, but it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;stand easy&rsquo; in port, and there&rsquo;ll
be time for all the yarning you want.&rdquo;<!-- Page 142 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>I closed with that offer at once, and eight bells
had not long gone before I had picked my precarious
way over to the <i>Sherill</i>, and climbed the
ladders to her snug little bridge. My man was
there already, whiling away the time by rewriting
an old college football song (he had been in his
freshman year at Michigan when America came into
the war) to fit destroyer work in the North Atlantic.
I found him stuck at the end of the second
line of the first verse, because the only rhymes he
could think of for flotilla were Manila and camarilla,
neither of which seemed sufficiently opposite
to be of use, and he was rather glad of an excuse for
putting the job by to await later inspiration.</p>

<p>I gave him a &ldquo;lead&rdquo; for the U-boat yarn he had
lured me there to hear, and he launched into it at
once. This is the story the young signalman of
U.S.S. <i>Sherill</i> told me, the while the red squares of
the cottagers&rsquo; windows blinked blandly along the
bank in the lengthening twilight and the purple
shadows of the western hills piled deeper and
duskier upon the &ldquo;quiet waters of the River Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;We were out on convoy,&rdquo; he said, speaking the
first words slowly between the teeth which held the
string of the tobacco sack from which the gently
manipulated paper in his hand had been filled. &ldquo;It
was some kind of a slow convoy&mdash;probably a collier
or an oiler or two&mdash;and there were only two of us
on the job&mdash;the <i>McSmall</i> and the <i>Sherill</i>. It was<!-- Page 143 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
just the usual ding-dong sort of a drudge up to
about four in the afternoon of the first day out,
when the <i>McSmall</i> made a signal that she had
sighted a submarine on the starboard bow of the
convoy, distant about five miles, and immediately
stood off to the west to see if anything like a strafe
could be started. She was more than hull-down on
the horizon when I saw, by the way the angle of
her funnels was changing, that she was man&oelig;uvring
to shake loose a few &lsquo;cans&rsquo; into the oil-slick
she had run into, but I remember distinctly that I
felt the jolt of the under-water explosions stronger
than from many we had kicked loose from the
<i>Sherill</i>, and which had detonated only a hundred
yards or so off. It&rsquo;s just a little trick the depth-charge
has. The force of it seems to shoot out in
streaks, just like an explosion in the air, and you
may feel it strong at a distance and much less at
fairly close range. So far as we ever learned, this
opening salvo did not find its target.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the <i>Sherill</i> was escorting to the best
of her ability alone. Or at least we thought we
were alone. About half an hour after the <i>McSmall</i>
had laid those first &lsquo;cans,&rsquo; however, one of the
quartermasters reported sighting a periscope on
the port quarter of the convoy, about five hundred
yards distant, and headed away. We signalled its
presence to the convoy, turned eight points to port,
and drove at full speed for the point where the wake
of the moving finger had pinched out.<!-- Page 144 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We had received a report that morning to the
effect that two submarines were operating in these
waters, and there is just the chance, therefore, that
this was a joint attack. Everything considered,
however, we have been inclined to believe that the
Fritz we were now starting to make the acquaintance
of was the same one which the <i>McSmall</i> was
still assiduously hunting some miles off to the westward.
It was a mighty smart piece of &lsquo;Pussy-wants-a-corner&rsquo;
work, shifting his position like
that under the circumstances; but it was quite
possible if the Fritz only had the guts for it, and
that I think you&rsquo;ll have to admit this particular
one had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seconds that count in a destroyer attack on
a U-boat, and the captain hadn&rsquo;t lost a tick in
jumping into this one. The dissolving &lsquo;V&rsquo; which
the ducked-in periscope had left behind it was still
visible in the smooth water when the <i>Sherill&rsquo;s</i> forefoot
slashed into it, and it was only a few hundred
yards beyond that a slow undulant upcoiling of
currents marked, faintly but unmistakably, the
under-water progress of the game we were after.
There was no oil-slick, understand, because an
uninjured submarine only leaves that behind&mdash;except
through carelessness&mdash;when it dives after
a spell on the surface running under engines. Then
the exhausts cough up a lot of grease and oil, and
a layer of this, sticking to the stern, leaves a trail
that rises for some little time after submergence,<!-- Page 145 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and which almost any kind of a dub who has been
told what to look for can follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spotting of the surface wake of a deep-down
submarine, and the holding of it after it almost
disappears with the slowing down of the screws that
make it, is quite another thing. <i>That</i> takes a man
with more than a keen eye&mdash;it takes instinct, mixed
with a lot of common sense. It&rsquo;s a common thing to
say of a successful look-out that he has a &lsquo;quick
nose for submarines.&rsquo; The expression is used more
or less figuratively, of course; and yet the nose&mdash;the
sense smell&mdash;is by no means a negligible factor
in detecting the presence, and even the bearing, of
a hunted U-boat. I will tell you shortly how it
figured in this particular instance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wake was swirling up so strong when we
struck it that it was plain the submarine was still
only on the way down, and it was no surprise when,
a few seconds later, the distinct form of it was
visible, close aboard under the starboard side of the
bridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that it was distinct in the sense
that you could see details such as the bow or stern
rudders, or even the conning-tower, but only that a
moving cigar-shaped blob of darker green could be
plainly made out. The for&rsquo;ard end was rather
more sharply defined than the after, probably because
the swirl from the propellers made uneven
refraction about the tail. It was doubtless a good
deal deeper than it looked, and the fact that it<!-- Page 146 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
could be seen at all must have been almost entirely
due to the fact that the absence of wind left the
surface quite unrippled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The appearance of the submarine abreast the
bridge was our cue to get busy, and I won&rsquo;t need
to tell you that we went to it good and plenty. We
were primed for just that kind of an emergency,
and we slapped down a barrage in a way that
looked more like chucking coppers for kids to
scramble after than the really scientific planting
of high explosives that it was. For a minute or two
the little old <i>Sherill</i>, dancing down the up-tossed
peaks of the explosions, jolted along like the canoe
you are dragging over a &lsquo;corduroyed&rsquo; portage.
Then the going grew smooth again, and under a
hard-over right rudder we turned back rejoicing to
gather in the sheaves. Yes, it looked quite as simple
as harvesting on the old home farm, and it
didn&rsquo;t seem that there could be anything left to do
but to go back and pick up with the rake what the
mower had brought low. And so it would have
been on an ordinary occasion, which, unluckily,
this was not. From the first to last, indeed, it was
quite the contrary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole map of that little opening brush was
spread out before us as we came back, and almost
as clearly, for the moment, as though modelled in
coloured clay. The <i>Sherill&rsquo;s</i> wake, though it had
obliterated that of the submarine, coincided with
the tell-tale swirl of the latter we had followed,<!-- Page 147 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
while the round patches of spreading foam made the
dizzily dancing buoys temporarily superfluous as
markers of the spots where the depth-charges had
exploded. Like every other story that is writ in
water, this one was rapidly dissolving; but, from all
that we needed to learn from it, the record was as
complete as a bronze relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there was to be another chapter to the
story became evident before we had doubled back
half the length of that part of the wake we had
sprinkled with &lsquo;cans.&rsquo; At about the point where
two-thirds of that sheaf of depth-charges had been
expended a clearly defined wake of oil and bubbles
turned sharply off to the left. The presence of that
little trail cleared up several important points
right then and there without following it any
farther, though I will hardly need to tell you that
we didn&rsquo;t drop anchor to hold a court of inquiry
over it. The vital thing it told us was that&mdash;strange
as it seemed&mdash;our under-water bombardment
had not sent the U-boat to the bottom, nor
even injured it sufficiently to compel it to come
to the surface. But that it was injured, and probably
fairly badly, was proved by the wake of oil
and bubbles. Don&rsquo;t ever let any one delude you
with that yarn about the way Fritz sends up oil
and bubbles to baffle pursuit. There may be circumstances
under which he could work that
particular brand of foxiness with profit, but if
there is one place where you could be sure he would<!-- Page 148 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<i>not</i> try anything of that kind on, it is when a destroyer
has got his nose on his trail, with her eye
and ears a-cock for just that kind of little first-aid
to &lsquo;can-dropping.&rsquo; For a submarine voluntarily
to release air or oil when a destroyer is ramping
round overhead would be just about like a burglar
scattering a trail of confetti to baffle the pursuit of
the police. Fritz is as full of ways that are dark
and of tricks that are vain as Ah Sin, but&mdash;with the
hounds at his heels&mdash;nothing so foolish as that oil
and bubble stunt of popular fiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first few of the &lsquo;cans&rsquo; had evidently burst
near enough to this Fritz to buckle his shell and
release the oil and air, but his sharp right-angled
turn to the left had taken him quite clear of the last
of the charges, which had only been thrown away.
Wounded and winged as he appeared to be, the next
thing in order was to polish him off. Slowing down
slightly, the captain steadied the <i>Sherill</i> on the
wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we passed the point where this was rising,
the rate at which it was extended gave the approximate
speed of the U-boat, and the fact that this
was not above three knots seemed only another
indication that all was not well with him. Holding
on past the &lsquo;bubble fount,&rsquo; we passed over the point
below which the U-boat must have been moving, but
now he was so much more deeply submerged than
before that no hint of his outline was visible on
either side. We knew he was there, however, and<!-- Page 149 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
when we hit the proper place shook loose another
shower of &lsquo;cans&rsquo; over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing deeply mysterious about the
calculations in dropping depth-charges, for in no
sense of the term can it be called an instrument of
precision. Indeed, it is of the bludgeon rather than
the rapier type. If you have a wake to guide, you
approximate his speed and course from that, guess
at his depth, set the charge at the corresponding
depth from which you judge its explosion will do
most good, and then, allowing for your own speed
and course, release it at a point which you reckon
the target will have reached by the time the charge
gets down on a level with it. It is something like
bomb-dropping from an aeroplane, only rather less
accurate, because you don&rsquo;t see your target as a
rule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is more than compensated for, however, by
the greater vulnerability of its target and the fact
that the force of an under-water explosion is felt
over a wider area than that of an air-bomb. That&rsquo;s
about all there is to it. Success in &lsquo;can-dropping&rsquo;
depends about half on the skill and judgment of
the man directing it, and about half on luck. Or
perhaps I should say that fifty-fifty was about the
way it stood when we started in at the game.
Naturally, as we have accumulated experience,
skill and judgment begin to count for more and
luck for less, though we are a long way from reaching
the point where the latter is eliminated entirely.<!-- Page 150 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Again we circled back to pick up the pieces, and
again we found only a wake of oil and bubbles
angling sharply off from where the &lsquo;cans&rsquo; had been
dropped. It was encouraging to note that both oil
and bubbles were rising faster than before, but
there was surprise and disappointment in the fact
that they were now streaming along at a rate which
indicated Fritz was hitting an under-water speed
of six or seven knots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By now it was plain what his method was, however.
This was to steady on his course till his
hydrophones, which all U-boats are fitted with, of
course, told him we were bearing down on him, and
then to start making &lsquo;woggly&rsquo; zigzags. The captain
was doing some deep thinking as we headed in
for the next attack, and I noticed him following
his stopwatch with more than usual care as he
jiggled off the &lsquo;cans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the detonations had a different kick from
the others, and I was just speculating if it had been
a hit, when up comes Fritz, rolling like a harpooned
whale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just turning sharp under left rudder
and, not wanting to take any chances, the captain
gave orders for all guns fearing to open fire. No.
1 and No. 2 of the port battery got off about five
rounds apiece, and when the splashes from the exploding
shells had subsided Fritz had gone. It
looked like a hundred to one that we had finished
him&mdash;until we ran into another of those darn wakes<!-- Page 151 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of oil and bubbles reeling off at a good five or six
knots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again we &lsquo;canned&rsquo; him, and again the thickening
trail of grease gave promise that, if nothing
else, we were at least bleeding him hard, perhaps
to death. As there was no doubt that he was still
a going concern, however, the captain decided on a
change of tactics, to try attrition, so to speak,
instead of direct assault.</p>

</div>
<h4>A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF &ldquo;CANS&rdquo; A DESTROYER CAN CARRY</h4>

<p>&ldquo;There is, of course, a limit to the number of
&lsquo;cans&rsquo; a destroyer can carry, and those which still
remained he wanted to husband against a better
chance to use them with effect. The several remaining
hours of daylight would be enough, if the U-boat
could be kept running at maximum speed, to exhaust
its batteries in and force it to come to the
surface for lack of power to keep going submerged.
A submarine, you understand, unless it can lie on
the bottom, which was impossible here on account
of the depth, must keep under weigh to maintain
its bouyancy, so it follows that the exhaustion of
its batteries leaves no alternative but coming up.
That was what we were now driving at with this
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this time, hearing the radio of the <i>Cushman</i>
close aboard, the captain sent a signal requesting
her help in clearing up the job in hand. She
hove in sight presently, accompanied by the <i>Fanny</i>,
which was out with her on some special stunt of
their own. They had an hour to spare for us, and<!-- Page 152 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in that time we played just about the merriest little
game of hide-and-seek that any of our destroyers
have had with a Fritz since the Yanks came over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t left time to sit and think for a single
minute. Now a destroyer would come charging up
his wake from astern and shy a &lsquo;can&rsquo; at his tail;
now one would ambush him from ahead and try and
have one waiting where his nose was going to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a good deal like when three or four of
us kids used to spear catfish in a muddy pool. We
were always grazing one, but never quite getting
it. And, believe me, the wake of one of those catfish
didn&rsquo;t have anything on the wake of that Fritz for
sinuosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was zigzagging constantly, and just after
charges had been dropped on him he twice broached
surface. It was only for a few seconds though,
and never long enough to offer a target for even a
ranging shot. Once we tried to ram, but he turned
as he submerged, and the forefoot cut into nothing
more solid than his propeller swirl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the <i>Cushman</i> and <i>Fanny</i> left us to resume
their own job the <i>Sherill</i> took up the chase again on
her own account. There were still about three
hours to go till dark, and two of these we spent in
keeping our quarry on the jump by every trick we
knew. Then we stood away, and gave him a chance
to come up and start charging on the surface.
When it finally became evident that he was not
going to take advantage of our consideration on this
score, we closed in again, picked up his wake, sent<!-- Page 153 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
down another &lsquo;can&rsquo; or two to tell him what we
thought of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last of these must have been near to a hit,
for it brought up oil bubbles three feet in diameter,
with smaller bubbles of air inside of them. The
oil-slick left behind by his wake was so heavy that,
even in the failing light, it was visible for several
miles. He was now making about five knots. We
followed that broad slick of oil for some time after
darkness had fallen, and it was not till a little
before midnight that we lost it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much hope of regaining touch
before daybreak, but on the off-chance the captain
started circling in a way that would cover a lot of
sea, and yet not take us too far from the centre of
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a little after one in the morning that
one of the look-outs&mdash;perhaps &lsquo;sniff-outs&rsquo; would be
a better term under the circumstances&mdash;reported an
oil smell to windward. The captain promptly
ordered her headed up into the wind, with sniffers
stationed to port and starboard, fore and aft.
Every man on watch was sniffing away on his own,
of course, and you can bet it would have been a
funny sight if there had only been enough light for
us to see one another in. Nosing&mdash;I can use the
term literally this time&mdash;slowly along, turning now
to port, now to starboard, as the oil smell was
strongest from this side or that, within ten minutes<!-- Page 154 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
we picked up a slick which, even in the darkness, it
was evident was trending to south&rsquo;ard. For an
hour and a half we zigzagged up along that wake,
keeping touch by smell until just before three
o&rsquo;clock, when the new well-risen moon showed it
up distinctly to the eye. No,&rdquo; answering my frivolous
interruption, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall noticing at the
time that it was a <i>blue</i> moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes later we came up to where the
wake turned to south-westward, and had a brief
glimpse of Fritz trying to evade detection by running
down the moon-path. He was plainly near
the end of his juice, and taking every chance that
offered to charge on the surface. He ducked under
before there was time for a shot, but, knowing that
he could hardly stay there for long, we continued
following down his wake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was broad daylight when, at half-past four,
we sighted him again, running awash about five
hundred yards ahead and slightly on the starboard
bow. Ordering the bow gun to open fire, the captain
put the <i>Sherill</i> at full speed and headed in to
ram. The shots fell very close, but no hit was
observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He turned sharply to port, preparing to dive.
We tried to follow with full left rudder, but missed
by twenty feet. His conning-tower and two periscopes
showed not over thirty feet from the port
side as we swept by. It was too close for a torpedo,
nor was there a fair chance for a depth-charge.<!-- Page 155 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
The port battery was opening on him as he submerged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The strengthening breeze began kicking up the
surface about this time, making it difficult to follow
the wake. It was six o&rsquo;clock before we circled into
it again, to find that Fritz was now trying to blind
pursuit by steering his course so that the wake led
away straight toward the low morning sun. It
was probably by accident rather than design that
his now reversed course also laid his wake across
some of the zigzags of his old oil-slick. At any rate,
between that and the sun, we got off the scent
again, and did not get in touch till an hour later,
when a thin blue-white vapour to the eastward
revealed the blow-off of his exhaust where he had
resumed charging on the surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a good five miles away, but we turned
loose at him with the bow gun and started closing
at full speed. At almost the same time, the
British sloop <i>Moonflower</i>&mdash;the same one we were
talking about this evening&mdash;stood in from eastward,
also firing at the enemy, who was about midway
between us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fritz disappeared under the foam-spouts
thrown up by the fall of shot, and, although two
more destroyers joined in the hunt, which was continued
all that day and on to nightfall, no further
trace of him was discovered. Even if he did not
sink at once, the chances are all against his being
in shape ever to get back to base. But just the<!-- Page 156 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
same,&rdquo; he concluded, with a wistful smile, &ldquo;it
would have been comforting to have had something
more tangible than the memory of an oil smell and
thirty-six hours without sleep as souvenirs of that
little brush.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It had been dark for an hour where the waters of
the River Lee were streaming seaward with the ebbing
tide, but the tree-tops along the crest of the
eastward hills were silvering in the first rays of the
rising moon. The signalman was looking at it
when I bade him good night and started down the
ladder to the main deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t a blue one,&rdquo; he said with a grin;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re expecting to go out again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>ADRIATIC PATROL</h3>


<p>Boring into a North Sea blizzard in a destroyer
off the coast of Norway is not exactly
the kind of thing that one would think
would turn a man&rsquo;s thoughts to sunny climes, with
scented breezes blowing over flowery fields, and
cobalt skies arching over sapphire waters, and all
that sort of thing; but the human mind moves in a
mysterious way, and that is just what Lieutenant
K&mdash;&mdash; started talking about the night we were
shepherding the northbound convoy together, after
it had been temporarily scattered by what had
proved to be an abortive German light cruiser raid.</p>

<p>Sea-booted, mufflered and goggled, and ponderous
where his half-inflated &ldquo;Gieve&rdquo; bulged beneath his
ample duffle-coat, he leaned over the starboard rail
of the bridge for a space to get the clear view
ahead that the frost-layer on the wind-screen
denied him from anywhere inboard. Then, just
ducking a sea that rolled in tumultuously fluent
ebony over the forecastle gun and smothered the
bridge in flying spray, he nipped across and threw
a half-Nelson around a convenient stanchion before
the pitch, as she dived down the back of the<!-- Page 158 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
retreating wave, threw him against the port rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em all in line again,&rdquo; he said, pushing his
face close to mine. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something to be thankful
for, anyhow. Didn&rsquo;t expect to round up half
of &rsquo;em before we had to stand away to pick up the
southbound. Piece of uncommon good luck. Now
we can stand easy for a spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was about to observe that &ldquo;stand easy&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t
seem to me quite the appropriate term to apply to
the act of keeping one&rsquo;s balance on a craft which
was blending thirty-degree rolls with forty-degree
pitches to form a corkscrew-like motion of an eccentricity
comparable to nothing else in the gamut of
human experience, when he continued with: &ldquo;Not
much like what I was enjoying a month ago, this,&rdquo;
indicating the encompassing darkness with a
rotary roll of his head. &ldquo;I was in a destroyer at
an Italian base then&mdash;Brindisi&mdash;with the smell of
dust and donkeys and wine-shops in the air, and
straight-backed, black-haired, black-eyed girls, with
rings in their ears and baskets of fruit&mdash;soft red
and yellow and blue fruit&mdash;on their heads. Now
it&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;and she put her nose deep into a wave that
dealt her a sledge-hammer blow and sent spray
flying half-way to the foretop in a solid stream&mdash;&ldquo;this,
just this. Grey by day, black by night, and
slap-bang all the time. No light, no colour, no
atmosphere, no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite understand,&rdquo; I cut in. &ldquo;No straight-backed
girls with rings in their ears and fruit-baskets<!-- Page 159 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
on their heads. Of course, there&rsquo;s more
light and colour down there than here; but wasn&rsquo;t
there also a bit of slap-bang to it now and then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, there was a bit,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There was
the time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He started to tell me the already
time-worn yarn of the Yarmouth trawler skipper
and the Grimsby trawler skipper, each of whom,
enamoured of the same Taranto maid, wooed her
while the other was absent on patrol; of how one
of them, looking through his glass as he stood in
toward the entrance on one of his return trips,
saw his rival walking on the beach with arm round
the waist of the artful minx in question, and her
red-and-yellow kerchief-bound head resting on his
shoulder; of how the one on the trawler, consumed
by a jealousy fairly Latin in its intensity, swung
round his six-pounder, discharged it at the faithless
pair, and&mdash;so crookedly did the rage-blind eyes see
through the sights&mdash;hit a fisherman&rsquo;s hut half a
mile away from his target!</p>

<p>I had heard the story in Taranto a year previously,
and knew it to be somewhat apocryphal at
best. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that kind of &lsquo;slap-bang,&rsquo;&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;I was under the impression that the destroyers
had some rather lively work down there
on one or two occasions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were several brushes which might have
been called lively while they lasted,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;I was in one of them myself just before I was
transferred north.&rdquo;<!-- Page 160 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the recent attack on the drifter
patrol&mdash;the one where two British destroyers stood
the brunt of the attack of four Austrian destroyers
and a light cruiser or two?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I have
always wanted to hear about that. I&rsquo;ve heard
Italian naval men say some very flattering things
of the way the British carried on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I was in the <i>Flop</i>&mdash;the
one that got rather the worst banging up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got time for the yarn before your
watch is over,&rdquo; I said, settling myself into the
nearest thing to a listening attitude that one can
assume on the bridge of a destroyer bucking a
north-east gale. &ldquo;Fire away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t much expect he would &ldquo;come through,&rdquo;
for I had failed in so many attempts to draw a good
yarn by a frontal attack of this kind that I had
little faith in it as compared with more subtle
methods. Perhaps it was because rough methods
were suited to the rough night; or it may have been
only because K&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s mind (his non-working
mind, I mean; not that closed compartment of
sense and instinct with which he was directing his
ship) had drifted back to the Adriatic, and he was
glad of the chance to talk about it; at any rate, in
the hour that had still to go before eight bells went
for midnight, to the accompaniment of the banging
of the seas on the bows and the obbligato of the
spray beating on the glass and canvas of the
screens, he told me the story I asked for.<!-- Page 161 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to tell you,&rdquo; he said, after giving
the man at the wheel the course for the next zigzag,
&ldquo;that the Adriatic is full of various and sundry
little traps and contrivances calculated to interfere
as much as possible with the even tenor of the
way of the Austrian U-boats which, basing at Pola
and Trieste, sally forth in an endeavour to penetrate
the Straits of Otranto and attack the commerce
of the Mediterranean. You doubtless also
know that this work is very largely in British
hands. This is no reflection whatever on our
Italian ally. Italy simply did not have the material
and the trained men for the task in hand, and since
Britain had both, it was naturally up to us to step
in and take it over. This was done over two years
ago; but, like the anti-submarine work everywhere,
it is only now just beginning to round into shape to
effect its ends. The winter of his discontent for the
U-boat in these waters is closing in fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will understand, too, that these various
anti-U-boats contrivances take a lot of looking after
to prevent their interference with, or even their
complete destruction, by enemy surface craft. All
the good harbours are on the east coast of the
Adriatic, and that sea is so narrow that swift
Austrian destroyers can raid all the way across it
at many points, and still have time to get back to
their bases the same night. With our own bases&mdash;the
only practicable ones available&mdash;at the extreme
southern end of the Adriatic, our greatest<!-- Page 162 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
difficulty, perhaps, has been in guarding against
these swift tip-and-run night-raids by the enemy&rsquo;s
speedy surface craft. I don&rsquo;t know whether the
fact that we seem to have about put an end to their
operations of this kind is a greater tribute to our
enterprise or the Austrians&rsquo; lack of it. The brush
in question occurred as a consequence of the latest
of the Austrian attempts to interfere with the
measures which, he knows only too well, will ultimately
reduce his U-boats to comparative impotence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was Number Two in the <i>Flop</i>, which, with the
<i>Flip</i>, was patrolling a certain billet well over
toward the Austrian coast of the Adriatic. We had
turned at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, and were heading
back on a westerly course, when the captain sighted
a number of vessels just abaft the starboard beam.
Being almost in the track of the low-hanging moon,
they were sharply silhouetted; but the queer atmospheric
conditions played such pranks with their
outlines that, for a time, he was deceived as to their
real character. The warm, coastal airs, blowing to
sea for a few hours after nightfall, have a tendency
to produce mirage effects scarcely less striking than
those one sees on the desert along the Suez Canal.
It was the distortion of the mirage that was responsible
for the fact that the captain mistook two
Austrian light cruisers for small Italian transports
(such as we frequently encountered on the run between
Brindisi and Valona or Santi Quaranti),<!-- Page 163 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and that he reported what shortly turned out to be
enemy destroyers as drifters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The captain had just made a shaded lamp signal
to the <i>Flip</i>, calling attention to the ships and
their supposed character, when the white, black-curling
bow-wave of the two leaders caught his eye
and made him suspect they were warships. The
alarm bell clanging for &lsquo;Action Stations&rsquo; was the
first intimation I had that anything was afoot. In
the Adriatic, as everywhere else, everyone in a destroyer
turns in &lsquo;all standing&rsquo;; so it was only a
few seconds until I was out of my bunk and up to
my station on the bridge. It was not many minutes
later before I found myself in command of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was now clear that the force sighted consisted
of two enemy light cruisers and four
destroyers, the latter disposed two on each quarter
of the rear cruiser. They were closing on us at
high speed at a constant bearing of a point or two
abaft the beam. It was up to the <i>Flip</i>, as senior
ship, to decide whether to fight or to run away on
the off-chance of living to fight another day, something
which was hardly likely to happen in the
event we closed in a real death grapple. The disparity
between our strength and that of the enemy
would have entirely justified us in doing our utmost
to avoid a decisive fight, had it been that the cards
on the table were the only ones in the game. But
this was hardly the case. Out of sight, but still
not so many miles distant, was another subdivision<!-- Page 164 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of our destroyers, while overwhelming forces would
ultimately be hurrying up to our aid in case the
enemy could be delayed long enough. To close in
immediate action was plainly the thing, and the
<i>Flip</i> was turning in to challenge even as she made
us a signal indicating that this was her decision.
A moment more, and we were turning into line
astern of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the moon-track now, the outlines of the
enemy ships were indistinct and shadowy, and it
was from the dull blur of opacity above the slightly
phosphorescent glow of the &lsquo;bone&rsquo; in the teeth of
the leading cruiser that the opening shot was fired.
It lighted her up brilliantly for the fraction of a
second, and the ghostly geyser from the bursting
shell showed up distinctly a few hundred yards
ahead of the <i>Flip</i>. Both the sharpened image of the
cruiser in the light of the gun-fire and the time of
flight of the shell helped us with the range, and the
fall of shot from the <i>Flip&rsquo;s</i> opener looked like a very
near thing. We followed it with one from our
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; gun, which was a bit short, and the next, if
not a hit, was only slightly over. At this juncture,
all six of the enemy ships came into action with
every gun they could bring to bear, and the <i>Flip</i>
and the <i>Flop</i> did the same. For the next few
minutes things happened so fast that I can&rsquo;t be
sure of getting them in anywhere near their actual
sequence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We began hitting repeatedly, and with good<!-- Page 165 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
effect, after the first few shots, and the <i>Flip</i> also
appeared to be throwing some telling ones home.
The enemy were hitting the both of us about the
same time, however, and, of course, with many
times the weight of metal we were getting to him.
At this juncture the skipper of the <i>Flip</i>, evidently
figuring that the Austrians, now that they were
fully engaged and had a good chance of polishing
us off, would not break off the fight, turned southward
with the idea of drawing them toward the
other forces which we knew would be rushing up
in response to the signal we had sent out the instant
the character of the strange ships was evident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Flip</i>, like a big squid, began smoke-screening
heavily as she turned, the <i>Flop</i> following suit.
The sooty oil fumes poured out in clouds thick
enough to walk on, but unluckily, neither our
course nor the state of the atmosphere was quite
favourable for making it go where it would have
served us best. Possibly it was because the <i>Flip</i>
was making a better screen than the <i>Flop</i>, or possibly
it was because they were concentrating on the
&lsquo;windy corner&rsquo; just as we were rounding it. At
any rate, trying to observe through our rather
patchy smoke the effect of what appeared to be a
couple of extremely well-placed shots of ours on
the leading cruiser, I suddenly became aware that
all four of the destroyers and the second cruiser
were directing all of their fire upon the poor little
<i>Flop</i>. I don&rsquo;t recall exactly whether I twigged this<!-- Page 166 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
before we began to feel the effects of it or not, but
I am rather under the impression that I seemed
to sense it from the brighter brightness&mdash;a gun
firing directly at you makes a more brilliant flash
than the same gun laid on a target ahead or astern
of you&mdash;of the flame-spurts even before I was aware
of the sudden increase of the fall of shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had us ranged to a yard by this time, of
course, and the captain turned away a couple of
points in an endeavour to throw them off. I recall
distinctly that it was just as the grind of the ported
helm began to throb up to the bridge that a full
salvo&mdash;probably from one of the cruisers&mdash;came
crashing into us. My first impression was that we
were blown up completely, for of the two shells
which had struck for&rsquo;ard, one had brought down
the mast and the other had scored a clean hit on the
forebridge. There was also a hit or two aft, but the
immediate effects of these were not evident in the
chaos caused by the others. This was absolutely
beyond description.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The actual shock to a ship of being struck by
a shell of even large calibre is nothing to compare
with that from almost any one of these seas that
are crashing over us now. But it is the noise of the
explosion, the rending of metal, and the bang of
flying fragments and falling gear that makes a
heavy shelling so staggering, to mind if not to body.
Of course everyone on the forebridge was knocked
flat by the explosion of the shell which hit it, and<!-- Page 167 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the worst of it was that the most of us didn&rsquo;t get up
again. The sub and the middy who were acting as
Control Officers were blown off their platform and
so badly knocked up that they were unable to carry
on. One signalman and one voice-pipe man were
killed outright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rest of us were only shaken up or no more
than slightly wounded by this particular shell, but
the one which brought down the mast added not a
little both to casualties and material damage. The
radio aerials came down with the mast, of course,
and it was some of the wreckage from one or the
other that fell on the captain, wounding him
severely in both arms. Dazed and shaken, he still
gamely stuck to the wreck of the bridge, but the
active command now fell to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This damage, serious as it was, was by no means
the extent of that inflicted by this unlucky salvo.
A third shell, as I shortly learned, had passed
through the fore shell-room and into the fore
magazine. In which it exploded I could not quite
make sure, but both were set on fire. This fire got
to some of the cordite before it was possible to get
it away, and the ensuing explosion killed or
wounded most of the supply parties and the crews
of the twelve-pounders. It was brave beyond all
words, the fight those men made to save the ship
down in that unspeakable hell-hole, and it was due
wholly to their courage and devotion that the explosion
was no worse than it was. This trouble,<!-- Page 168 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
luckily, was hardly more than local, but a number
of good lives was the price of keeping it so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one other consequence of that salvo,
and though it sounds funny to tell about it now, it
might well have made all the difference in the world
to us. In the bad smashing-up of the bridge of any
ship by shell-fire the means of communication with
the rest of her&mdash;the voice-pipes, telephones, telegraphs,
etc.&mdash;are among the first things to be
knocked out. This means, if there are no alternatives
left, that directions have to be relayed around
by shouting from one to another until the order
reaches the man to carry it out. This would be an
awkward enough expedient for a ship that is not
under fire and fighting for time and her life. What
it is with the enemy&rsquo;s shell exploding about you,
and with your own guns firing, I will leave you to
imagine. Well, we had all this going on, and besides
that a fire raging below that always had the
possibilities of disaster in it until it was extinguished.
Also, we were already short-handed
from our losses in killed and wounded. There
wasn&rsquo;t anyone to spare to relay orders about in any
case. But what capped the climax was this: When
the mast was shot down, some of the raffle of rigging
or radio fouled the wires leading back to both
of the sirens, turning a full pressure of steam into
them and starting them blowing continuously. It
was almost as though the poor maimed and mangled
<i>Flop</i> were wailing aloud in her agony.<!-- Page 169 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it that way at the time, though,
for I had my hands full wailing loud enough myself
to make even the man at the wheel understand what
I wanted him to do. Luckily, the engine-room telegraph,
though somewhat cranky, was still in action,
and orders to other parts of the ship we managed
to convey by flash-lamp or messenger. It was ten
minutes or more before they contrived to hush the
sirens&mdash;it was cutting off their steam that did it, I
believe&mdash;and by then a new and even more serious
trouble had developed through the jamming of the
helm. It was hard over to starboard at that, so
that the <i>Flop</i> simply began turning round and
round like a kitten chasing its tail. This involuntary
man&oelig;uvre had one favourable effect in that
it seemed to throw the Austrian gunnery off for a
bit, though one shell which penetrated and exploded
in the after tiller-flat shortly after she began
cutting capers did not make it any easier to coax
the jammed helm into doing its bit again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our &lsquo;ring-around-the-roses&rsquo; course had resulted
in our coming much nearer to the enemy,
who, seeing a chance to finish us off, was trying to
close the range at high speed. Our rotary course
brought them on a continually shifting bearing, and
it was while they were coming up on our port bow
at a distance of less than a mile that it suddenly
became evident that the cruisers were about to
present us the finest and easiest kind of a torpedo
target. The captain, who, in spite of his wounds,<!-- Page 170 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
was still trying to stick the show through, saw the
opening as soon as I did, and, because there was no
one else free to attempt the trick, tackled it himself.
But it was a case of the spirit being willing and the
flesh weak. With every ounce of nerve in him he
tried to make his almost useless hands work the
forebridge firing-gear. The chance passed while
he still fumbled frantically but vainly to release the
one little messenger&mdash;a mouldie&mdash;that would have
been enough to square accounts, and with some to
spare. It was the hardest thing of all&mdash;not being
able to take advantage of that opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was twenty minutes before the helm was of
any use at all, and the Austrians had only their
lack of nerve to thank for not putting us down
while they had a chance. It must have been because
they were afraid of some kind of a trap, for
there were a half-dozen ways in which a force of
their strength could have disposed of a ship as helpless
and knocked-out generally as was the <i>Flop</i>.
The <i>Flip</i> had also been hard hit, and when I had
a chance for a good look at her again it appeared
that her mast, like ours, was trailing over the side.
She was still firing, however, and it was she rather
than the enemy that was trying to close. We were
quite cut off from wireless communication, as all
attempts to disentangle the aerials from the
wreckage of the mast had been unsuccessful; but it
was evident that help was coming to us, and that
the Austrians had in some way got wind of it. At<!-- Page 171 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
any rate, our immediate responsibilities were over.
We had prevented the enemy from reaching his
objective, and possibly delayed him long enough for
some of our other ships to have a chance at harrying
his retreat. It was now up to us to limp to
port on whatever legs we had left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were still a long way from being out of
action even now, but with the fires continuing to
burn fiercely in the fore magazine and shell-room,
with the helm threatening to jam every time course
was altered, and with a considerable mixture of
water beginning to make its presence felt in the
oil, there was no telling what complications might
set in at any moment. As one of the Italian bases
in Albania was rather nearer than any port on the
other side of the Adriatic, it was for that we set
our still erratic course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our troubles were not yet over, however. Just
as the moon came down and sat on the sea preliminary
to setting, squarely against the round
yellow background it formed I saw the silhouette
of the conning-tower of a U-boat. At almost the
same instant the helm jammed again. Then it
worked free for a few seconds, but only to jam
presently, just as before. This continued during
two or three minutes, and just as it was wangled
right and we began to steady again I saw the wake
of a torpedo pass across our bows. Half a minute
later another one missed us in the same way, and
by about the same distance. I have always thought<!-- Page 172 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
that nothing but that providential jamming of the
helm just then saved us from intercepting both of
those mouldies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fires in the fore shell-room and magazine
were eventually got under control by flooding, and
we were fairly cushy when we dropped anchor at
base a little before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>K&mdash;&mdash; lurched over to the starboard rail and
counted the dark blurs that represented the units of
the straggling convoy. He was wiping snow and
spray from his face as he slid back on the roll to
our stanchion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine place, Southern Albania,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Plenty of heat and dust and sunshine and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never did hear what the rest of those Albanian
attractions were. At that juncture dusky figures
emerging from the deeper gloom of the ladder
heralded the appearance of the middle watch, and
for those relieved, including myself, the world held
just one thing&mdash;a long, narrow bunk, with a high
side rail to prevent the occupant from rolling out.
You go at your sleep on a destroyer as a dog dives
at a bone, for you never know how long it may be
before you get another chance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>PATROL</h3>


<p>The Senior Naval Officer (or the S.N.O., as
they clip it down to) at X&mdash;&mdash; had prepared
me for finding an interesting human exhibit
in the sharp-nosed, stub-sterned little craft snuggled
up to the breast of its mothership for a drink
of petrol, or whatever other life-giving essence she
lived and laboured on, but hardly for the highly
diversified assortment that was to reveal itself to
me during those memorable days we were to rub
shoulders and soak up blown brine and grog together
as they threaded the gusty sea lanes of her
winter North Sea patrol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sending you out on M.L.<span class="fnanchor"> <a name="footnoted" id="footnoted"></a><a href="#footd">[D]</a></span> &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; the S.N.O.
had said as he gazed down with an affectionate
smile at the object of his remarks, &ldquo;for several reasons,
but principally on account of the men that
are in her. You&rsquo;ll find them a living, breathing
object-lesson in the adaptability of the supposedly
stodgy and inflexible Anglo-Saxon race. Her skipper,
to use one of his own favourite expressions, is
a live wire&mdash;always seems to be able to spark when
there&rsquo;s trouble in the wind. He came from somewhere
<!-- Page 174 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
in Western Canada, I believe. Seems to have
tried farming there for a spell, and I think he said
something once about running his own agricultural
tractor. At any rate, in some way or another, he
has picked up more practical knowledge of petrol
engines than many of our so-called experts.</p>
<div class="footnote"><a name="footd" id="footd"></a>
<a href="#footnoted">[D]</a> Motor launch.
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; continued the S.N.O. as we turned
back towards his office at the end of the quay, &ldquo;the
fact is that D&mdash;&mdash;, though he never saw salt water
before he crossed the Atlantic to do his bit in the
War, and though he never has got and never will
get, I&rsquo;m afraid, his sea-legs, is in many respects the
most useful M.L. Officer I have ever had to do with,
and that&rsquo;s saying a good deal, let me assure you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s always sick as a dog from the time he puts
to sea to the time he returns to port. The only
thing that is liable to be more sick is the Hun submarine
he once gets his nose on. I&rsquo;ve heard him
say in a joking way, two or three times, that he
always could scent a Hun as far as he could a
skunk&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s what he calls it; and from
some of the things he&rsquo;s done I must confess I&rsquo;m
more than half inclined to believe him. Perhaps
his most remarkable achievement, however, is that
of taking eight or ten men, just as green as he was
himself regarding the sea, and making of them a
crew that will handle that cranky little lump of a
craft pretty nearly as smartly as old trawler-men
would on the nautical side, and at the same time
having a fund of resource always on tap that is<!-- Page 175 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
positively uncanny&mdash;almost Yankee, in fact,&rdquo; he
added with a smile. &ldquo;Indeed, I believe D&mdash;&mdash;
speaks of having knocked about the States a bit,
which may account for some of the &lsquo;wooden-nutmeg&rsquo;
tricks he has played on the U-boats. Try
to get him to tell you some of them. You&rsquo;ll hardly
be allowed to write much of them for a while yet&mdash;certainly
not until they have become obsolete
through the introduction of new devices; but you&rsquo;ll
find it good material some day.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>M.L. &mdash;&mdash; looked more diminutive than ever as I
was rowed out to her anchorage in the chill grey
mists of the following morning; but a raw cold,
which had been striking through to the marrow of
my bones, dissolved, as by magic, before the friendly
warmth of the welcome which awaited me, when I
had clambered up the sawn-off Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder and
over the wobbly wire rail. A slender but lithely
active chap in a greasy overall and jumper, to give
it the Yankee name, gave me a finger-crushing grip
with his right hand, while with his left he deftly
caught and saved from immersion my kit-bag, which
had fallen short in the toss that had been given it
from below. Just for an instant the absence of
visible insignia of rank made me think that he was
a petty officer of engineers, or something of the
kind; then the magnetism of his personality flowed
to me through the medium of his hand-clasp, and I
knew I was looking into the eyes of a man who<!-- Page 176 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
would not be likely to figure for long as anything
less than &ldquo;Number One&rdquo; on any kind of job he
ever undertook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time for a &lsquo;square,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said
heartily, leading the way to the tiny hatch and preceding
me down the ladder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be needing it,
too, after that pull with nothing more than that
sloppy dish-wash kaffy-o-lay that you get at the
hotel at this hour of the morning on your stomach.
Don&rsquo;t try to bluff me that you had anything more.
I know by sad experience. Now <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> give you something
that&rsquo;ll stick to your ribs. What do you say
to some Boston baked beans and a &lsquo;stack o&rsquo; hots&rsquo;?
Guess I know what a &rsquo;Murican likes. Sorry my
maple syrup&rsquo;s gone, but here&rsquo;s some dope I synthesised
out of melted sugar and m&rsquo;lasses&mdash;treacle,
they call it over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reaching the lower deck, we edged along to a
transom at the end of a table which all but filled
the tiny dining-cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake hands with Mac,&rdquo; said the skipper by
way of introducing me to a tall and extremely good-looking
youth in a Cardigan jacket, duffel trousers,
and sea-boots, who rose with a smile of welcome as
we dropped down beside him. &ldquo;Mac&rsquo;s a Canuck,
like myself,&rdquo; he went on, after asking me if I liked
my eggs &ldquo;straight up&rdquo; or &ldquo;turned over,&rdquo; and passing
the order on to a diminutive Cockney with a
comedian&rsquo;s face, who came tripping in almost as
though wafted on the &ldquo;smell o&rsquo; cooking&rdquo; which<!-- Page 177 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
preceded him through the opened galley door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mac learned his sailoring on his dad&rsquo;s yacht on
Lake Ontario, and I learned mine driving a &lsquo;deep-seagoing&rsquo;
side-wheel tractor on a ranch in Alberta.
Only time I was ever afloat before I became a
&lsquo;Capt&rsquo;in in the King&rsquo;s Navee&rsquo; was on a raft on the
old Missouri, in Dakota; and that isn&rsquo;t really being
afloat, you know, for &rsquo;bout one half the water of
that limpid stream is mud and the other half catfish.
A great pair of old salts, we two&mdash;hey, Mac?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the rest of the crew&rsquo;s no more &lsquo;saline&rsquo;
than its &lsquo;orfficers.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the way they say it,
ain&rsquo;t it, Mac? Little &rsquo;Arry, the galley-slave, was a
knock-about artist in the London music-halls before
he &lsquo;eard the sea a-callin&rsquo;, and now he doesn&rsquo;t &rsquo;eed
nothin&rsquo; else, do you, Harry? And you&rsquo;ll hear the
sea a-callin&rsquo; that nice big breakfast of yours just as
soon as we get outside the Heads, won&rsquo;t you, Harry?
And then you won&rsquo;t &rsquo;eed nothin&rsquo; else for quite a
while. And so&rsquo;ll Mac hear the sea a-calling his
breakfast, and so&rsquo;ll I, and so&rsquo;ll all the rest of us&mdash;every
mother&rsquo;s son. It&rsquo;s a fine lot of Jack Tars we
are, the whole bunch of us. Did I tell you that one
of my quartermasters is an ex-piano-tuner, and that
the other was a Salvation Army captain before he
entered the Senior Service for the duration? And
my Chief&mdash;that&rsquo;s him you hear alternating between
tinkering and swearing at the engines on the other
side of that bulkhead you&rsquo;re leaning against&mdash;owned
a motor-boat of his own before the War, and<!-- Page 178 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
appears to have divided his waking hours between
racing that and his stable of motor-cars? You can
tell he was a gentleman once by the fluency of his
cussing. He&rsquo;s the only man I&rsquo;ve met over here that
could give yours truly any kind of a run in dispensing
the pungent persiflage; but I had the advantage
of driving mules as a kid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But cussing, though it helps with a lot of things,
doesn&rsquo;t make a sailor, and the Chief&rsquo;s no more of
a Jack Tar than me or Mac or Harry. Fact is, that
the only man aboard who ever made his living out
of the sea before the war is a fisherman from the
Hebrides; and even the glossary in the back of my
Bobbie Burns won&rsquo;t translate his lingo. Two or
three times, when the sea has been kicking up a bit,
he has managed to tell us that no self-respecting
God-fearing sailor would be oot in such weather.
Possibly he&rsquo;s been right; but, as none of us are
sailors, we don&rsquo;t feel called on to pay much attention
to his ravings. Our duty is to harass any Huns
that encroach on our beat; and the fact that we&rsquo;ve
had a modicum of success in that line proves you
don&rsquo;t have to be a sailor to qualify for the job.
Which don&rsquo;t mean, though,&rdquo; he concluded with a
smile of sad resignation as he rose and reached for
his oil-skins, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t hope and pray that
I&rsquo;ll develop the legs and stomach of a sailor before
the war&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When breakfast was eaten, forward and aft, all
hands were piped on deck, and in less than ten<!-- Page 179 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
minutes M.L. &mdash;&mdash; was under way and threading
the winding channels of a cliff-begirt Firth to the
mist-masked waters of the North Sea.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As I picked my way forward to the little
glassed-in cabin, which served the double purpose
of navigating-bridge and wheel-house, I told myself
that I was sure of two things&mdash;first, that the skipper,
by birth, breeding, residence, and probably
citizenship, was an American of Americans, and,
second, that the chances were he would not admit
that fact unless I &ldquo;surprised him with the goods.&rdquo;
An Englishman will often mistake a Canadian for
an American but a Yankee himself will rarely make
that error. I was sure of my man on a dozen
counts, and resolved to lay in figurative ambush
for him.</p>

<p>I all but had him within the hour. We were clear
of the Heads, and the skipper, having turned over
to Mac, was trying to forget that imperious call o&rsquo;
the sea he had chaffed &rsquo;Arry about by showing me
round. He had explained the way a depth-charge
was released, and was just beginning to elaborate
on the functions of an old-fashioned lance-bomb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now this fellow,&rdquo; he said, balancing the ungainly
contrivance and giving it a gingerly twirl
about his head, &ldquo;is a good deal like the sixteen-pound
hammer which I used to throw at college.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing that the hammer-throw was not a Canadian
event, I promptly cut in with &ldquo;What college?&rdquo;<!-- Page 180 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
&ldquo;Minnesota,&rdquo; he answered readily enough;
adding, as I began to grin: &ldquo;A good many Canadians
go across there for the agricultural courses.&rdquo;
I resolved to await a more favourable opportunity
before bringing my &ldquo;charge&rdquo; point-blank. It came
that afternoon, when I stood beside him on the
bridge as he bucked her through ten miles of slashing
head-sea, which had to be traversed to gain the
shelter of a land-locked bay beyond a jutting point,
where we were to lie up for the night. He was
telling me U-boat-chasing yarns in the patchy intervals
between the demands of <i>mal de mer</i> and
navigation, and one of them ended something like
this: &ldquo;Old Fritz&mdash;just as we intended he should&mdash;caught
the reflection of the flame through his
upturned periscope and, thinking his shells had set
us afire, rose gleefully to gloat over his Hunnish
handiwork. Bing! I let him have it just like
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motion with which he flung the lemon he had
been sucking as an antidote for sea-sickness could
not have been in the least suggestive of what really
happened; but that straight-from-the-shoulder, elbow-flirting,
right-off-the-ends-of-the-fingers action
was so like another motion with which I had long
been familiar, that, with a meaning side-squint, I
observed promptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you add baseball to your other accomplishments,
do you? Did a bit of pitching, if I don&rsquo;t
miss my guess? How long have you played?&rdquo;<!-- Page 181 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I was a kid,&rdquo; he admitted with a grin that
sat queerly on the waxy saffron of his sea-sick face.
&ldquo;Yes, I even &lsquo;tossed the pill&rsquo; at college&mdash;that is,
until a shoulder I knocked out trying to slide home
one day spoiled my wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew I had him the instant that first admission
left his lips. &ldquo;Since the kids weren&rsquo;t playing sand-lot
baseball in Canada twenty years ago,&rdquo; I said,
ducking low to let the spray from a sea which had
just broken inboard blow over, &ldquo;you might just as
well &rsquo;fess up and tell me which neck of the Mississippi
Valley you hail from. Just as one Yankee
to another,&rdquo; I pressed, as his piercing eye turned on
me a look that seemed to bore right through and
run up and down my spine; &ldquo;even as one Middle
Westerner to another, for I was born in Wisconsin
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant his lips hardened into a straight
line, and the flexed jaw-muscles stood out in white
lumps on either side; then his mouth softened into a
broadening grin, and a moment later he burst into
a ringing laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing, old man, since you put it on &lsquo;sectional&rsquo;
grounds, and since we&rsquo;re going to be shipmates
for a week, and&rdquo;&mdash;fetching me a thumping
wallop on the back&mdash;&ldquo;since we both wear the same
uniform, anyhow, curly stripe and all, I&rsquo;ll make a
clean breast of it. I was born in Kansas&mdash;got a
farm there, near a little burg called Stockton, to-day&mdash;and
was never out of the Middle West in my<!-- Page 182 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
life till I crossed over into Canada to enlist in the
first year of the war. I felt I had to get into the
show somehow, and the little old U.S.A. was hanging
fire so in the matter of coming in that I just
couldn&rsquo;t wait. I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story when
we&rsquo;re moored for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have never been able to recall my yarn with
D&mdash;&mdash; that evening without a hearty guffaw. A
rising barometer had cleared the grey smother of
mist from the sea, but a shift of the wind from
south-east to north-east exposed us to a blast which,
chilled at its fount in the frozen fjords of Norway,
knocked the bottom out of the thermometer and
filled the air with needle-like shafts of congealed
moisture that seemed to have been chipped from
the glassy steel dome of the now cloudless sky.
There was a filigree of frost masking the wheel-house
windows before the early winter night
clapped down its lid, and the men who went forward
to pass a line through the ring of the mooring-buoy
pawed the icy deck with their stiff-soled sea-boots
without making much more horizontal progress
than a squirrel treading its wheel.</p>

<p>It would have been bracing enough if there had
been a cheery open fire, or at least a glowing little
sheet-iron stove, to thaw and dry out at, as there
is on most patrol craft, and even on many trawlers.
But in the particular type to which M.L. &mdash;&mdash; belonged
(the units of which are said to have been<!-- Page 183 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
built in fulfilment of a rush order given one winter
on the assumption that the War would be over before
the next) there was no refinements and few
comforts. Heating is not included among the latter:
the only stove in the boat being in the galley,
where the drying of wet togs in restricted quarters
is responsible for a queer but strangely familiar
taste to the pea-soup and Irish stew which you never
quite account for until you discover the line of
grease on the corner of the tail of your oilskin or
the toe of your sea-boot.</p>

<p>The diminutive electric heaters are true to the
first part of their name rather than the last: that is
to say, while they are undeniably electric, it is
equally certain that they do not heat. There <i>is</i> a
certain amount of warmth in them, as I discovered
the time I scorched my blankets by taking one to bed
with me; but that is of use only when you can confine
it and apply locally, which is rarely practicable
in a small craft at sea, even when you have the time
for it.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood, therefore, why on
a M.L., at sea in really wintry weather, the only
alternative to sitting up and being slowly but surely
chilled to the marrow is to doff wet togs as soon as
you come off watch, don dry ones, bolt your dinner,
and turn in. This is just what we had to do on
M.L. &mdash;&mdash; that night; for, besides the really intense
cold, a sea which came through the sky-light
of the little dining-cabin early in the afternoon had<!-- Page 184 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
drenched cushions and curtains, with enough left
over to form an inch or two of swashing swirl upon
the deck. Poor &rsquo;Arry, with the effects of the &ldquo;call
o&rsquo; the sea&rdquo; still showing in his hollow eyes and
pasty cheeks, was not in shape to do much either in
the way of &ldquo;slicking up&rdquo; or &ldquo;snugging down&rdquo;;
while the extent of his culinary effort was limited to
a kedgeree of half-boiled rice and pale canned
salmon, and a platter of eggs fried &ldquo;straight up,&rdquo;
according to D&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s order, with the yolks glaring
fish-eyedly at you from a smooth, waxy expanse of
congealed grease. D&mdash;&mdash;, who was still somewhat
&ldquo;introspective&rdquo; himself, turned down the
&ldquo;straightups&rdquo; straightaway, bent a look that was
more grieved than angry on the forlorn &rsquo;Arry, and
then, rising shiveringly, started edging along over
the sodden divan toward his cabin door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As principal medical officer of this ship,&rdquo; he
said through chattering teeth, &ldquo;I prescribe the only
treatment ever found to be efficacious in such circumstances
as the present&mdash;bunk, blankets, and
hot toddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two bunks in D&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s narrow cabin,
and it was not until we had turned into these&mdash;he in
the lower, I in the upper&mdash;that the mounting glow
of soul and body thawed the reserve which had
again threatened to grip him in the matter of
where he came from, and set his tongue wagging of
his life on the old home farm, and from that to a
sketchy but vivid recital of things that he had done,<!-- Page 185 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and hoped still to do, as the skipper of a British
patrol boat. It is the vision that the memory of
that recital conjures up: D&mdash;&mdash;, with a Balaclava
helmet pulled low over his ears, gesticulating excitedly
up to where I, the unblanketed portion of
my anatomy shrouded to the eyes in a wool duffel-coat,
leaned out over the edge of the bunk above&mdash;that
I can never dwell on without laughing outright.</p>

<p>The story of the way in which it happened that
D&mdash;&mdash; came over to get into the game in the first
place did not differ greatly from those I have heard
from a score or more of young Americans who,
partly inspired by a sense of duty and partly lured
by the promise of adventure, sought service in the
British Army or Navy by passing themselves off as
Canadians. He had intended to enlist in the Army
at first; but when he found that six months or more
might elapse before he would be sent to the other
side, he crossed at his own expense on the chance of
avoiding the delay. At the end of a disappointing
month spent in trying to enlist in some unit that
had a reasonable expectation of going into active
service at once, the intervention of an old college
friend&mdash;an able young chemical engineer occupying
a prominent post in Munitions&mdash;secured him a sub-lieutenant&rsquo;s
commission in the R.N.V.R. Although,
as he na&iuml;vely put it, the sea was no friend
of his, it appears that the M.L. game had proved
congenial from the outset: so much so, indeed, that<!-- Page 186 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
something like three years of service found him
with two decorations and innumerable mentions to
his credit, to say nothing of the reputation of being
one of the most resourceful, energetic and generally
useful men in a service in which all of those qualities
are taken more or less as a matter of course.
He had gone in as a Canadian for fear that he
might be turned down as a Yankee, and then, to
use his own words: &ldquo;By the time the U.S.A. began
to take a hand, I had told so many darn lies about
hunting and fishing and farming in Alberta and
British Columbia that I concluded it would be less
trouble to go on telling them than to start in denying
them. The boundary between Canada and the
U.S.A. is more or less of an imaginary line, anyhow,
and so is that between the average Yankee and
Canuck. I reckon I&rsquo;ve made it just as hot for the
Hun as the latter as I would have as the former,
and that&rsquo;s really the only thing that counts at this
stage of the game.&rdquo; It was this last observation, I
believe, which started D&mdash;&mdash; talking of his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Generally speaking,&rdquo; he said, reaching up the
match with which he had just lighted a cigarette to
rekindle the tobacco in my expiring pipe, &ldquo;the
r&ocirc;le of the M.L. is very much more defensive than
it is offensive. It is supposed to police certain
waters, watch for U-boats, report them when
sighted, and then carry on as best it can till a destroyer,
or sloop, or some craft with a real punch in
it, comes up and takes over. Well, my idea from<!-- Page 187 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the first has been to make that &lsquo;defensive&rsquo; just as
&lsquo;offensive&rsquo; as possible, and it&rsquo;s really astonishing
how obnoxious some of us have been able to make
ourselves to the Hun. Off-hand, since, with his
heavier guns, the average Hun is more than a
match for us even on the surface, there wouldn&rsquo;t
seem much that we could do against him beyond
running and telling one of our big brothers. The
perfecting of the depth-charge gave us one very
formidable weapon, however, and that of the lance-bomb
another, though the days when Fritz was
tame and gullible enough to allow himself to be
enticed sufficiently near to permit the use of the
latter are long gone by. The most satisfying job
I ever did, though, was pulled off with a lance-bomb;
and, since there is not one chance in a thousand
of our ever getting away with the same kind
of stunt again, there ought to be no kick on my telling
you just how it happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, pulling a big furry-backed
mitten on the hand most exposed to the cold
in gesticulation, and tucking the fingers of the other
inside the neck of the Balaclava for warmth,
&ldquo;Fritz is an animal of more or less fixed habits,
and so the best way to hunt him, like any other
animal, is to begin by making a study of his little
ways. I specialised on this for some months, confining
myself almost entirely to what he did in
attacking, or when being attacked by, M.L.s, and
ignoring his tactics with sloops, trawlers, and other<!-- Page 188 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
light craft. It wasn&rsquo;t long before I discovered that
his almost invariable practice&mdash;when it was a matter
of only himself and a M.L.&mdash;was to get the
latter&rsquo;s range as quickly as possible, endeavour to
knock it out, or at least set it afire, by a few hurried
shots, and then to submerge and make an approach
under water for the purpose of making a closer
inspection of the damage inflicted. In this way the
danger of a hit from the M.L.&rsquo;s gun was reduced to
a minimum&mdash;an important consideration, as a
holing by even a light shell might well make it
impossible to submerge again. And a U-boat incapable
of seeking safety in the depths is, in any
part of the North Sea where it would have been
likely to meet a M.L., just as good as done for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also found that when explosions had taken
place in the M.L., or when it was heavily afire by
the time the U-boat drew near, it was the practice
of the latter to come boldly up and finish the good
work at leisure, with the addition of any of the
inimitable little Hunnisms&mdash;such as firing on the
boats, or ramming them, or running at full speed
back and forth among the wreckage so as to give
the screws a good chance to chop up the swimming
survivors&mdash;of which <i>Unterseeboot</i> skippers were
even then becoming past masters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; here D&mdash;&mdash; paused for a moment
while he lifted the little electric heater and lighted
a fresh cigarette on one of the glowing bars, &ldquo;in
short, I studied the vermin in just the same way I
did the gophers and prairie-dogs when I started to<!-- Page 189 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
exterminate them on my Kansas farm. I found out
when they were most likely to come up, when to
stay down; what things attracted them, and what
repelled. Then I went after them. Of course, there
was no chance for the clean sweep I made of the
gophers and prairie-dogs, but we&rsquo;ve still managed
to keep our own little section of the beat pretty
clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having satisfied myself regarding the Hun&rsquo;s
penchant for stealing up, submerged, to gloat over
the dying agonies of his victim, it seemed to me that
the obvious thing to do was to lead him on with an
imitation death-agony, and then have a proper surprise
waiting for him when he came up to gloat.
The first thing I started working on was how to
&lsquo;burn up&rsquo; and &lsquo;blow up&rsquo; with sufficient realism to
deceive the skipper of a submerged U-boat, and still
be in shape to spring an effective surprise if he
could be tempted into laying himself open to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first plan proved too primitive by far. I
reckoned that the &lsquo;blowing-up&rsquo; touch might be provided
by dropping a depth-charge, and that of
&lsquo;burning up&rsquo; by playing my searchlight on the
surface of the water on the side the approach was
to be expected from. Neither was good enough.
The &lsquo;can&rsquo; might have been set to explode on the
surface, but that could not be affected without running
the chance of blowing in my own stern. But
the bing of a depth-charge detonating well under<!-- Page 190 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the water is quite unmistakable, and the first U-boat
I tried to lure with one made off forthwith,
plainly under the impression that it was the object
of an active attack. As for the searchlight, I saw
that it wouldn&rsquo;t do the first time I went down and
took a peep at a trial of it through the periscope of
one of our own submarines. The beam did cast
a patch of brightness discernible through the upturned
&lsquo;eye&rsquo; at a depth of from sixty to eighty
feet, but it was neither red enough nor fluttery
enough to suggest anything like a burning ship. I
set to work to devise something more life-like, without
ever waiting for a chance to draw a Fritz
with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First and last, I tried a goodly variety of &lsquo;fire&rsquo;
experiments,&rdquo; D&mdash;&mdash; continued, snuggling down for
a moment with both arms under the blankets, &ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t mind admitting that I&rsquo;d like to have a few
of &rsquo;em, smoke and all, flaming up all over this
refrigerator right now. The thing I finally decided
to try consisted of nothing more than a light, shallow
tank of ordinary kerosene&mdash;paraffin oil, I believe
they call it here&mdash;made fast to a small,
roughly built raft. The <i>modus operandi</i> was as
simple as the contrivance itself. As soon as a U-boat
was sighted, the raft was to be launched on the
<i>opposite</i> side, and kept about thirty feet out by
means of a light boom. The next move was to be
up to Fritz, and it was fairly certain he would do
one of two things&mdash;submerge and make off, or remain<!-- Page 191 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
on the surface and begin to shell us. In the
latter case we were to start firing in reply, of
course; but that was only incidental to the main
plan. This was to wait until we were hit, or, preferably,
until he fired an &lsquo;over,&rsquo; the fall of which,
on account of his low platform, he could not spot
accurately, and then to fire the tank of kerosene. A
line to a trigger, rigged to explode a percussion-cap,
made it possible to do this from the rail. As
the flames, besides giving off a lot of smoke, would
themselves leap high enough to be seen from the
other side, it was reasonable to suppose that Fritz
would be deluded into thinking we were burning
up, and make his approach a good deal more carelessly
than otherwise. If he persisted in closing
us on the surface, there would be nothing to it but
to make what fight we could with our fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; gun,
and try to make it so hot for him that he would have
to go down before his heavier shells had done for
us. But if, following his usual procedure, he made
his approach submerged, then there were two or
three other little optical and aural illusions prepared
for his benefit. I will tell you of these in describing
how we actually used them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>D&mdash;&mdash; lay quiet for a minute, the wrinkles of a
baleful grin of reminiscence showing on both sides
of the aperture of the Balaclava. &ldquo;The first chance
we had to try the thing out it nearly did us in,&rdquo; he
chuckled presently. &ldquo;No, Fritz had nothing to do
with it. <i>He</i>, luckily for us, submerged and beat it<!-- Page 192 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
off after firing three or four shots&mdash;probably
through mistaking the smoke of a couple of trawlers
just under the horizon for that of destroyers.
It was all due to bad luck and bad judgment&mdash;principally
the latter, I&rsquo;m afraid. It was bad luck to
the extent that the U-boat was sighted down to
leeward, so that there was no alternative but to put
over my &lsquo;fire-raft&rsquo; on the windward side. The bad
judgment came in through my underestimating the
force of the wind and the fierceness with which the
kerosene would burn when fanned by it. Scarcely
had it been touched off before there was a veritable
<i>Flammen-werfer</i> playing against thirty or forty
feet of the windward side, and in a way which made
it impossible for a man to venture there to cast off
the wire cables which moored the raft. As this
class of M.L.s have wooden hulls, you will readily
see that this was no joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The splash of the beam seas proved an efficacious
antidote, so far as the hull was concerned,
however; but how some other highly inflammable
material I was carrying &rsquo;midships escaped being
fired in the minute or more that I was swinging her
through sixteen points to bring the raft to the leeward
of her&mdash;&mdash; Well, I can only chalk that up to
the credit of the special Providence that is supposed
to intervene especially to save drunks and
fools. You can bet your life I never let myself be
tempted into making that break again, though it
involved a trying exercise of self-restraint when it<!-- Page 193 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
chanced that the very next Fritz I sighted also bore
down the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two or three U-boats which were sighted
in the course of the next five or six weeks ducked
under without firing a shot, and I was beginning to
think that perhaps they had somehow got wind of
my little plan and were taking no chances in playing
up to it. Then, one fine clear morning, up
bobs a Fritz about six thousand yards to windward,
and begins going through his part of the
show almost as though he was one of our own submarines
with which I had been rehearsing. His
firing at us was about as bad as mine at him; but
he finally lobbed one over that was close enough,
so I knew he couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it was a hit or
not, and on that I touched off the fire-raft, which
was soon spouting up a fine pillar of flame and
smoke. To discourage his approach on the surface,
I kept up a brisk firing to give him the impression
that we were going to live up to British Navy traditions
by going down fighting, and to convince him
that it would be much safer to close under water.
This came off quite according to plan, and presently
I saw the loom of his conning-tower dissolve
and disappear behind the spout of one of our
shells, which looked to have been a very close
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood on at a speed of five or six knots, but
on a course which I reckoned he would anticipate
and allow for. When I figured that he was not<!-- Page 194 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
over a mile away, I dropped a float over the stern
with a time-bomb attached to it, the detonation of
which in this way I had found by experiment to
furnish a much more life-like imitation of an internal
explosion in a ship&mdash;when heard in hydrophones,
I mean&mdash;than that of a depth-charge. The
periscope which was shortly poked cautiously up
for a tentative &lsquo;look-see&rsquo; could not, I am pretty
nearly dead certain, have revealed anything to belie
the impression I had laid myself out to convey&mdash;that
M.L. &mdash;&mdash; was an explosion-riven, burning,
and even already, probably a sinking ship. Besides
the gay gush of flames from the fire-raft, which must
have appeared to be roaring amidships, lurid
tongues of fire were also spouting out of the forrard
and after hatches, and from several of the ports;
while a thirty-degree list to starboard might well
have indicated that she was about to heel over and
go down. I had looked at her that way from a
periscope myself, while I was studying the effect of
some &lsquo;stage property&rsquo; flares in comparison with
ordinary gasoline &lsquo;blow-torches,&rsquo; and knew how
much she looked like the real thing even when you
knew she wasn&rsquo;t. The list? Oh, that was a very
simple matter. This class of M.L.s is never on an
even keel for long, anyhow, and the installation of
a couple of tanks made it possible to pump water
back and forth and give her any heel we wanted.
We put her almost on her beam ends when we were
experimenting on the thing, and without upsetting<!-- Page 195 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
things much outside of the galley, which we had
neglected to warn of what devilry was afoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t look helpless and harmless enough
for any Fritz to run right up alongside and &lsquo;gloat
over,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll eat my hat; and that was what I was
counting on this fellow doing. Indeed, I&rsquo;ll always
think that was just what he <i>did</i> intend to do eventually;
only it was the way he went about doing it
that was near to upsetting the apple-cart. It
seemed reasonable to suppose that he would come
up and do his gloating on the side he approached
from, and so that was the side I had prepared to
receive him on. The heavy list she was under to
starboard would have made it possible to bring the
gun to bear on him until he was almost under the
rail, and then there would be a chance for a lance-bomb.
If he came up on the other side by any
chance, I had figured that the game would be all
up; for there was the fire-raft to give it away,
while the list would be on the wrong slant to give
the gun a show. Well, whether it was accident or
intent, that is just what he did&mdash;broached abeam to
port, about half a cable&rsquo;s length off the sizzling
tank of flaming kerosene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That next minute or two&rdquo; (D&mdash;&mdash; sat up in bed
in the excitement of the memory of that stirring interval,
and I felt one of his gesticulating fists
come with a thump against the bottom of my mattress)
&ldquo;called for some of the quickest thinking
and acting I was ever responsible for pulling off.<!-- Page 196 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
If he stayed up, it flashed to my mind, there was
just the chance I might ram him; while if he ducked
down, there would probably be a good opening for
a depth-charge. I rang up full speed at the same
time I was shouting orders to cast off the fire-raft,
and to bash in one end of the starboard &lsquo;tilting-tank&rsquo;
with an axe. We had considered the possibility
of this emergency arising, as much as we
hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t, so that no time was lost in
meeting it. The fire-raft, boom and all, was cast
off clean, and quickly left astern. In scarcely less
time was the tank emptied, though the sudden flood
from it&mdash;it was on the upper deck, understand&mdash;came
very near to carrying overboard the man who
broached it. With motors, of course, we were running
all out in &lsquo;two jerks,&rsquo; and she was doing several
knots over twenty when, with helm hard-a-starboard,
she began rounding on the startled
Fritz.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no doubt about the fact that he <i>was</i>
startled, let me tell you. And, when you think of
it, it must have been a trifle disconcerting to see
the blown-up and burning boat he had come up to
gloat over, and perhaps loot before she went down,
suddenly settle back on an even keel and come
charging down on him at twenty-five knots. The
&lsquo;moony&rsquo; fat phizes that showed above the rail of
the bridge were pop-eyed with surprise&mdash;yes&mdash;and
indecision, too, for there were several valuable seconds
lost in deciding whether to come on up&mdash;she<!-- Page 197 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
had risen to the surface with only an &lsquo;awash&rsquo;
trim&mdash;and make a fight with her gun, or to dive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would have made a great deal
of difference in his own fate which he did, but you
can bet it made a lot of difference to me. I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you that I was never gladder about
anything in my life&mdash;at least anything since the
rain that came at the end of a three-months&rsquo;
drought to save my corn-crop a few years back&mdash;than
when those moon-faces went into eclipse and
I saw him begin to submerge. Although it had
never formed a part of any plan I had ever worked
out, I give you my word that I fully intended to
ram him, and that would have meant&mdash;well, about
the same thing as one airplane charging into
another. I should almost certainly have finished
him, while at the same operation&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t need
to tell you that a match-box like this was never
made for bull-at-a-gate tactics. I&rsquo;ve never heard of
one of this class of M.L.s getting home with a good
square butt at a U-boat, and I&rsquo;m very happy to
say that it didn&rsquo;t happen on this occasion. I don&rsquo;t
think that we even so much as grazed his &lsquo;jump-string&rsquo;;
but the whole length of him was in plain
sight sloping away from his surface swirl, and it
was easy as picking ripe pippins to plant an &lsquo;ash-can&rsquo;
just where it was needed. The only aggravating
thing about it was that, although oil came boiling
up in floods for three days, there was never a
Hun, nor even an unmistakable fragment of U-boat<!-- Page 198 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
wreckage, picked up as a souvenir. There was
never any doubt about the sinking, however, for
the trawlers located the wreck on the bottom with
a sweep, and gave it a few more &lsquo;cans&rsquo; for luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the best evidence in my own mind,&rdquo; concluded
D&mdash;&mdash;, pulling the blankets up higher over
his shoulders as he settled back into the bunk, &ldquo;is
the fact that, six weeks later, the identical stunt I
had tried this time actually lured another Fritz
up to eat out of my hand almost exactly as I had
been planning for. Now, if that first one had really
survived and been able to return to base, it is certain
that its skipper would have told what he saw,
and that there would have been a general order
(such as came out some months later when they
finally did twig the game) warning all U-boats
against coming up to gloat at close range over
burning M.L.s. The fact that this second one was
such easy picking proves beyond a doubt that the
other never got back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That last was the one you &lsquo;threw the hammer&rsquo;
at, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I asked, leaning far out to make my
words carry down to D&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s now blanket-muffled
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the wool-dulled answer. &ldquo;Tell you
some other night. Gotta get warm now. Toddy
can&rsquo;s empty. Make a tent of the blankets with your
knees, and take the electric heater to bed in it, if
you can&rsquo;t stop shivering any other way. Good
night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>&ldquo;Q&rdquo;</h3>


<p>At three miles, as seen from the bridge of the
battleship, the small craft which was steering
a course that would bring her across our
bows in the course of the next few minutes was
absolutely nondescript, completely defying classification.
A mile closer, however, it appeared to be
as plain as day that she was some ancient fishing
boat, but bluffer of bow and broader of beam than
the oldest of trawlers or drifters in the service. It
was only when she was right ahead, and but six or
eight cables&rsquo; lengths distant, that a vagrant sun-patch
came dancing along the leaden waters beyond
her to form a scintillant background against which
she stood out as what she was&mdash;the sweetest-lined
little steam yacht that ever split a wave. The fishing-boat
effect had been obtained by a simple
arrangement of colours which effectually clipped
the clippiness from her clipper bows and equally
effectually discounted the graceful overhang of her
counter.</p>

<p>In plain words, they had blocked in the lines of a
bluff, squatty tug on her hull with some kind of
paint that was very easy to see, and covered the<!-- Page 200 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
rest of her with a paint that was very hard to see.
A few changes in rig, and the alteration was complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite the cleverest and simplest bit of camouflage
I ever saw,&rdquo; said the captain, lowering his
binoculars. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the fact that we&rsquo;re looking
down on her from a considerable height against
that bright sheet of water that gives a chance to
follow her real lines at all. From the deck&mdash;and
even more so from the bridge of a submarine, or
through its periscope&mdash;it would be a lot easier to
tell what she <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> than what she <i>is</i>. As a matter
of fact, I can&rsquo;t say that I know what she is even
now. It is evident that she <i>was</i> a yacht, and no
end of a beauty at that. But now, in that guise&mdash;probably
some sort of patrol or anti-U-boat worker,
for a guess, perhaps a &lsquo;Q.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer of the watch turned aside for a moment
from the gyro across which he had been sighting.
&ldquo;I think she must be the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Some American millionaire had her in the Mediterranean,
and, wanting to do his bit, brought her
up to Portsmouth and turned her over to the Admiralty
to do what they wanted with her so long
as it would help to lick the Hun. She&rsquo;s been mixed
up in several kinds of stunts, and is supposed to
have a U-boat or two to her credit. Her present
skipper&rsquo;s a Yank who came to her from a M.L.
They say he&rsquo;s no end of a character, but right as
rain on his job and with a natural nose for trouble.<!-- Page 201 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
One of his hobbies is making his ship look what
she isn&rsquo;t, and, in order to see her as she would appear
to a U-boat, he goes out and studies her
through the periscope of one of our own submarines.
When one of these isn&rsquo;t handy, he sometimes
goes out in a whaler and studies her through
a stubby periscope poked over its gunwale. He
got blown right out to sea one night when he was
making some experiment from a whaler in &lsquo;moonlight
visibility,&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t get back till the next
morning. It had no effect on his enthusiasm,
though, for he was out on the same stunt the next
night. No question about his nerve, nor his luck,
nor his skill, for that matter. Smart seamanship
probably has as much to do with the fact that he
has never been torpedoed as has his fancy camouflage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made up my mind at once that here was a man
worth meeting and hearing the story of, but as the
only base he seemed to have was not easy to reach,
and as his ship was reported at sea on the only
occasions I was free to go there, some weeks went
by before I was able to carry out my plan of paying
him a visit. Then, one morning, a nondescript
craft, which might have been anything from a
wood-pile to a Chinese junk half a mile away, came
nosing inconsequentially through the lines of the
Grand Fleet and moored alongside the very battleship
in which I happened to be at that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;K&mdash;&mdash; has come in with the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; to &lsquo;swing<!-- Page 202 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
compasses,&rsquo;&rdquo; the navigating officer announced to
the ward-room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a &lsquo;converted side-wheel
river ferry-boat&rsquo; this morning, or something of the
kind; and he&rsquo;s going to get blown to sea in a &lsquo;sudden
gale,&rsquo; or something of the kind; and he says
that, if anyone doesn&rsquo;t believe it, to come aboard
and he&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em something to stimulate their
&lsquo;stolid British imaginations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As certain lockers of the &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; had not been
entirely looted of their age-mellowed treasure when
the yacht was dismantled for sterner service than
lounging about limpid Mediterranean harbours,
the doubters were, naturally, many; but it is pleasant
to be able to record that those who came to scoff
remained&mdash;to tea. Indeed, it was not until after
tea that I had a chance for a half-hour&rsquo;s yarn alone
with K&mdash;&mdash; in the &ldquo;banquet-hall-deserted&rdquo; splendour
of the stripped saloon. It was then that he
told me how it was he chanced to &ldquo;come across
and get into the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He used the latter expression several times, I
remember, and to no one that I can recall having
met, either on land or sea, was the grim work he
was doing more of a &ldquo;game&rdquo; than to this brave,
resourceful, devil-may-care Middle Westerner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had had a fair bit of experience in yachting
and boating during the last six or eight years before
the outbreak of the war,&rdquo; he said, settling back at
ease in one of the two remaining lounging-chairs,
&ldquo;and most of it has stood me in good stead at one<!-- Page 203 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
time or another since I have been on the job over
here. I sailed a single sticker on Lake Michigan
for a number of seasons, and I used to run down
from my home in Lake Forest to business in Chicago
in my own motor-boat on and off during the
summer. It was what I knew of the latter which
got me on a &lsquo;M.L.&rsquo; without any preliminary hanging
about when I first came over early in the war.
What I knew about sailing has been all to the good
almost every day I have been at sea, from the time
I lured on a U-boat by ringing up my &lsquo;M.L.&rsquo; as
a disabled fishing-smack to the time when I had to
bring this poor little old girl into port under canvas
after I had knocked out her propellers with one
of her own depth-charges.&rdquo; It was a fantastically
amusing tale, that last. &ldquo;It was the culmination
of my experiments in scientific camouflage,&rdquo; said
K&mdash;&mdash;, with a baleful smile. &ldquo;Up to that time
any contrivances to deceive the Hun were getting
more and more intricate right along; since then
they have tended more and more toward extreme
simplicity. It was this way, you see, that I happened
to work up to that depth-charge crescendo.
From the first I had been striving to give the U-boat
mixed impressions of me, especially on the
score of which way I was going. This, as I soon
found out from studying the thing in the proper
way, is much easier to do in the case of a man
whose observation is limited to a few feet above the
water than in the case of one who has a more lofty<!-- Page 204 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
coign of vantage to con from. That is to say, it&rsquo;s
much easier to convey false impressions, especially
regarding your direction, to a man with his eye to
a periscope than to one in the foretop of a battleship,
to take the two extremes. Trying now one
thing and now another as I had more experience,
I found that where at first every shot fired at me
was directed ahead with a more or less approximate
allowance for the ship&rsquo;s progress in that
direction, after a while they began to go oftener
and oftener astern, indicating they were confused
as to my rate of change. It was just as I was
about to put the crowning touch on my efforts in
&lsquo;mixing direction&rsquo; that the trouble occurred. As
the experiments with this particular contrivance
never went any further, there will hardly be any
harm in my telling you what it was and how it
worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had already, with the aid of a couple of slanting
fins, attached something after the fashion of
bilge-keels, only just below the water-line on either
quarter, worked up a fairly satisfactory &lsquo;bow
wave&rsquo; aft, and I was endeavouring to supplement
this by a scheme for making it appear as though
the sky was moving past her funnel in the direction
it wasn&rsquo;t. You see, I was working on the same
principle which deceives you when you think the
standing train you are in is in motion when you
see the one on the next track start up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the U-boat skipper&rsquo;s &lsquo;look-see&rsquo; is often<!-- Page 205 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
limited to a hurried sort of a peep, I figured that if
I could contrive to keep a rather conspicuous imitation
sky of canvas running past the masts and
funnels in the same direction she was going, only
faster, it might create the illusion&mdash;in the distorted
&lsquo;worm&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; vision of the man at the
periscope&mdash;that she was going in the opposite
direction. I studied some make-shift rigs from
water-level through a periscope, and made up my
mind the scheme was worth trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>K&mdash;&mdash; relighted his cigar and resumed with a
sad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still think the idea was good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
it took too complicated an installation to carry it
out, especially on a small craft with a low freeboard.
There were gearings and transmissions and
rollers, and heavens knows what not, needed to
make the endless strip of canvas &lsquo;sky&rsquo; run
smoothly, and there were also many wires and
ropes. It was one or the other of the latter which
was responsible for the disaster, for while the thing
was still in the &lsquo;advanced experimental&rsquo; stage a
U-boat popped up close by one day&mdash;probably a
bold attempt on its skipper&rsquo;s part to see if he
really saw what he thought he had seen&mdash;and I
spun the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; around on her tail (one of the nice
things about her is that she will turn in a smaller
circle than most destroyers) and tried, first choice,
to ram him, and, second choice, to drop a depth-charge
down the hole he had ducked into. I was too<!-- Page 206 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
late to ram by a few seconds, and there must have
been a good fathom or two of clearance between my
keel and the conning-tower I had driven for. The
bridge and the two periscopes he had &lsquo;turtle-necked&rsquo;
in showed clean and sharp in the clear
water as I leaned over the port side of the bridge&mdash;the
easiest chance a man ever had for kicking off
a &lsquo;can&rsquo; just where it ought to go. As I turned to
the depth-charge release I already had visions of
him falling apart like a cracked egg, with bobbing
bubbles and howling Huns coming up to the surface
together. It was only a couple of days before
that I had picked up several British fishermen&mdash;all
that were left alive after a U-boat skipper had
vented his morning hate by shelling the boat in
which they were leaving their sinking trawler&mdash;and
I was still mad enough to want to ram Heligoland
if a chance had offered. I felt a kind of
savage joy in the chance to put that tin of T.N.T.
where it would wipe out a bit of the score I had
been checking up against the Hun, and I seemed
to see a sort of a Hand of Fate in the fist I was
reaching up to the handle of the release. It
couldn&rsquo;t miss, I told myself, and&mdash;well, it didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The explosion &lsquo;jolted&rsquo; at the proper interval
all right, but not in the proper place, nor in the
proper way. I was watching for the up-boil
squarely in the middle of the right-angling propeller
swirl of the submarine, but that was receding,
smooth and unbroken, when the crash came. The<!-- Page 207 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
fact is, I never did see the spout from that charge&mdash;for
the very good reason that it was tossed up
almost under the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s&rsquo; counter, where it
knocked off the blades of both propellers and all
but blew in her stern. The depth-charge had
fouled a trailing wire from some of my &lsquo;stage
scenery sky&rsquo; and been dragged along to detonate
close astern. I saw her taffrail shiver and kick upwards,
and the shock was strong enough to upset
my balance even on the bridge. That last was the
first thing that made me sure something had
slipped up, for, ordinarily, the jolt from a properly
set &lsquo;can&rsquo; is no more than that from a sharp bump
against the side of a quay. I mean the jolt as felt
on the bridge, of course; below, and especially in
the engine-room or stokehold, it is a good deal more
severe. It was the shattering jar of this one that
told me it had gone wrong, and then, when she
began to lose way and refuse to answer her helm&mdash;the
rudder had been knocked out, too, but not
enough so that it couldn&rsquo;t be tinkered up to serve
temporarily&mdash;I knew it was something serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a good deal of a relief to find that, badly
buckled as some of the plates were, she wasn&rsquo;t making
any more water aft than the pumps could easily
take care of. That was the first thing I looked
after, and the next was the U-boat; or rather, we
were looking out for both at the same time. If
there was one thing more than another that helped
to reconcile me to the double disappointment of<!-- Page 208 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
missing my crack at the Hun and knocking my own
ship out, it was the fact which soon became apparent,
that Fritz never knew about the latter. If
he <i>had</i> known the shape I was in, he could have
finished me off a dozen times over during the hour
or more the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo; was lying helpless, and before
the first armed trawler showed up in answer to my
S.O.S. Just why he didn&rsquo;t, I could never make
quite sure, but the chances are it was one or both
of two things. It is quite possible that the biff
from the depth-charge&mdash;which must still have been
almost as near to him as it was to me when it exploded&mdash;may
have done the submarine really
serious injury, perhaps even sinking it. We never
found any evidence, however, that this had been
the case. Whether he was damaged or not, there is
no doubt that his close call gave him a bad scare.
There could have been nothing in the explosion to
tell him that it did any harm to his enemy, and,
since he did not have his periscope up, there was
no way he could see what had happened. Doubtless
expecting another &lsquo;can&rsquo; any moment, and
knowing well that it would be only a matter of an
hour or two until there would be a lot more craft
joining in the chase, it is probable that he followed
the tactics which you can always count on a U-boat
following when it knows a hunt is on&mdash;that is,
to submerge deeply and lose no time in making itself
just as scarce as possible in the neighbourhood
where the hue-and-cry has started. That&rsquo;s the only<!-- Page 209 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
way I can account for the fact that this particular
pirate didn&rsquo;t have a revenge after his own Hunnish
heart. We were about evenly matched for guns
probably, and doubtless I would have had rather
better than an even break on that score, because a
surface craft can stand more holing than a submarine.
But there was nothing to prevent his
taking a sneaking sight through his periscope from
a safe distance and then slipping a mouldie at us,
which, helpless as we were for a while, there would
have been no way of avoiding. A moving ship of
almost any class, provided it has a gun to make
him keep his distance, has a good fighting chance
of saving herself from being torpedoed by the
proper use of her helm; a disabled ship, though
she has all the guns in the world, has no show if
the Fritz really thinks she&rsquo;s worth wasting two or
three torpedoes on. If he has his nerve, and any
luck at all, he ought to finish the job with one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I think you&rsquo;ll have to admit,&rdquo; said K&mdash;&mdash;
with a whimsical smile, &ldquo;that, under the circumstances
and considering what might have happened,
I felt that I had no legitimate kick coming in having
to take her home under sail. Fact is, I considered
myself in luck to have a ship to take home
at all. The rudder, luckily, though a good deal
bent and twisted, had not been blown away. It
took a lot of nursing to turn it, and, when we finally
got her off under mainsail, forestaysail and jib,
the eccentricities it developed took a lot of getting<!-- Page 210 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
used to. Although it was quite fortuitous on our
part, the course we steered during the thirty hours
we put in returning to base was the most complex
and baffling lot of zigzagging I ever had anything to
do with. If a U-boat skipper lying in wait for us
could have told what she was going to do next, I
can only say that he would have known a lot more
than I did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of an hour or two a couple of trawlers
hove in sight and closed us to be of what help
they could in screening. They made a very brave
show of it until we got under weigh, and then they
were led just about the wooziest dance you ever
heard tell of. By a lucky chance, for me, not for
the trawlers, there was a spanking breeze on the
port quarter (for the mean course to base, I mean);
and it wasn&rsquo;t long before the little old girl, even
under the comparatively light spread of sail on
her, was slipping away at close to nine miles an
hour. That won&rsquo;t surprise you if you noticed the
lines of her. I&rsquo;ve turned back in her log and found
where she&rsquo;s run for thirty-six hours at fourteen
miles, even with the drag of her screws, which always
knock a knot or two off the sailing speed of
a yacht with auxiliary power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that nine miles an hour was a good bit
better than those trawlers could do under forced
draught, and after falling astern for a while, they
started to catch up by shortening their courses by
cutting my zigzags. That was where the fun came<!-- Page 211 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
in. It would have been easy enough if I had been
zigzagging according to Hoyle. But where I didn&rsquo;t
know myself just what she was going to do next,
how was I going to signal it to them, will you tell
me? About every other time that they tried to
anticipate my course they guessed wrong, and were
worse off than before as a consequence. They
must have been a very thankful pair when one of
the two destroyers which finally came up took them
off to hunt the submarine. The other destroyer
stood by to escort me in. Her skipper offered me
a tow, but I was anxious to save face as much as
possible by returning on my own, and so declined.
In case of an attack it would have been better to
have him screening than towing anyhow. In the
end, when we got in to where the sea room was restricted,
I was glad to take a hawser from a tug
they sent to meet me to keep from putting her on
the mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well believe that effectually put an
end to my experiments with &lsquo;movable sky,&rsquo; and
other similar mechanical complexities,&rdquo; K&mdash;&mdash; continued
with a laugh. &ldquo;Indeed, from that time on
I have been inclining more and more to simpler
things, rig outs that are sufficiently free from
wheels within wheels to leave the mind clear for
the real work in hand, which, after all, is putting
down the Hun, not merely deceiving him as to what
you are. You see how simple a setting our present
one is; yet it is very complete in its way, and I<!-- Page 212 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
have reasonable hopes of success with it. No, I can
hardly tell you just what I am driving at with it,
or just how I am going to go about it. In a month
or two, when its possibilities have been exhausted
and it has become a wash-out perhaps I shall be a
bit freer to talk about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and spend a day or two with me at the
end of about six weeks, when my present round of
stunting will probably be over, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
all the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; yarns that the law allows. The Hun
is dead wise to the game on principle, so there can&rsquo;t
be any point in keeping mum any longer on stunts
that he&rsquo;s twigged a year or so ago, and which you&rsquo;d
have about as much chance of taking him in with
as you&rsquo;d have in trying to sell a gold brick on
Broadway.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Three months went by before I was able to take
advantage of K&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s invitation to pay him a visit
at what he had called his &ldquo;business headquarters,&rdquo;
and as I had naturally expected that she would have
played many and diverse parts in the interim, it
was with some surprise that I found the &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
still &ldquo;dressed&rdquo; as she had been when I last saw
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never quite been able to pull it off,&rdquo;
K&mdash;&mdash; explained, &ldquo;and the waiting, and the not-quites
and the might-have-beens have given me no
end of a dose of that kind of hope deferred which
maketh the heart sick. But we&rsquo;ve at least been<!-- Page 213 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
lucky enough not to queer the game by showing our
hand, so that there&rsquo;s still as good a chance as ever
to make good with it under favourable circumstances.
For that reason, the less we say about it
for the present the better. That&rsquo;s in regard to
this particular stunt, I mean. As for the rest of the
&lsquo;Q&rsquo; stuff that we&rsquo;ve brought off, or tried to bring
off, during the last three years&mdash;I&rsquo;m at your service
to-night after dinner. The Germans have been
publishing accounts of some of the stunts, under
the title of &lsquo;British Atrocities,&rsquo; for some months
now, but as there are slight variations from the
truth here and there, you may still be interested
in getting some of the details a bit nearer the original
fount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They claimed, for instance, that when one of
their &lsquo;heroic&rsquo; U-boats ran alongside an armed
British patrol boat, which had surrendered to it,
to transfer a boarding-party, an officer of the
M.L. rushed on deck and threw down on the deck
of the submarine what the skipper of the latter took
to be a packet of secret books, and that this
&lsquo;packet,&rsquo; exploding, eventually resulted in the
sinking of the guileless German craft. Now, about
the only thing which is correct about that account
is the statement that a U-boat was sunk. It wasn&rsquo;t
an armed M.L. that surrendered to Herr Ober-Lootenant&mdash;armed
M.L.&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t do that sort of
thing, take my word for it&mdash;but an unarmed, or
practically unarmed, pleasure yacht, which had<!-- Page 214 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
apparently become disabled and blown to sea.
And the trusting U-boat did not come alongside to
put aboard a prize crew to navigate its captive to
a German port as they&rsquo;d try to make you believe,
but only to sink it with bombs placed in the hold,
so as to save shells or a torpedo. And it wasn&rsquo;t a
packet of secret books that put the pirate down,
but a &lsquo;baby,&rsquo; and <i>my</i> baby at that. No, I don&rsquo;t
mean that I threw a real child of mine to Moloch&mdash;I
haven&rsquo;t any to throw&mdash;but only that the idea of
this literal <i>enfant terrible</i>, with a percussion cap
on the top of his head and a can of T.N.T. for a
body, originated under my hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not surprising that the Huns didn&rsquo;t get
the thing straight at first, though I believe one of
their later versions does have a child in the cast,
for none of the Germans present have yet returned
to tell just what happened. About half of them
never will see their beloved &lsquo;Vodderland&rsquo; again,
and I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I&rsquo;m not wearing
any crepe on my sleeve on that account, either.
Do you know&rdquo;&mdash;K&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s face flushed red and his
brow contracted in the anger the thought aroused&mdash;&ldquo;that
those &mdash;&mdash; pirates were going right ahead
to sink what they thought was nothing but a pleasure
yacht, with a number of women and children
in it, although it was plain as day to them that
the one boat carried would founder under a quarter
of our number? That&rsquo;s your Hun every time, and
it was just that insensate lust of his to murder<!-- Page 215 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
anything helpless that I reckoned on in baiting my
trap. I felt dead certain&mdash;&mdash; But I&rsquo;ll tell you the
whole yarn this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several bits of salvage from the &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s&rdquo; pleasure-yacht
days figured in the little feast K&mdash;&mdash; had
spread that evening, and I remember particularly
that the Angostura was from a bottle Commodore
P&mdash;&mdash; had himself secured at the time
when that incomparable bitter was distilled in a
little ramshackle pile-built factory at Ciudad Bolivar,
on the upper Orinoco. And the coffee that
same genial <i>bon vivant</i> had had blended and sealed
in glass by an old Arab merchant at Aden, while
the Benedictine had cost him a climb on foot
through an infernally hot August afternoon to an
ancient monastery inland of Naples. It was between
sips of Benedictine&mdash;from a priceless little
Morning Glory-shaped curl of Ph&oelig;nician glass,
picked up in Antioch one winter by the owner, and
overlooked in the &ldquo;stripping&rdquo; operations&mdash;that
K&mdash;&mdash; told me the story of the first of what he
called his &ldquo;Q-rious&rdquo; operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a story attached to just about every
little package of food and drink P&mdash;&mdash; left in the
yacht,&rdquo; said K&mdash;&mdash;, unrolling the gold foil from a
cigar whose band bore the name of a Pi&ntilde;ar del Rio
factory which is famed as accepting no order save
from its small but highly select list of private customers
in various parts of the world; &ldquo;and in the
several letters he has written begging me to make<!-- Page 216 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
free with them he has told me most of the yarns.
The consequence was that, while the good things
lasted&mdash;they&rsquo;re most of them finished now&mdash;I was
getting in the way of enjoying eating and drinking
them, telling where they came from and how they
were come by, just about as much as good old P&mdash;&mdash; himself
must have done. In fact, I think that their
possible loss was about my worst worry when I
tried my first &lsquo;Q&rsquo; stunt on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The success of any kind of stunt for harrying
the U-boat is very largely a matter of psychology,
and this is especially so in the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; department.
The main point of it is to make the enemy think
you are more harmless than you really are. There
is nothing new in the idea, for it is precisely the
same stunt the old pirate of the Caribbean was on
when he concealed his gun-ports with strips of canvas
and approached his victims as a peaceful merchantman.
As a matter of fact, I think it was the
Hun himself who started the game in this war, for
I&rsquo;m almost dead sure that we had tried nothing
of the kind on&mdash;in a systematic way, at any rate&mdash;up
to the time one of his U-boats rigged up a mast
and sails and lured on victims by posing as a
fisherman in distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obviously, it&rsquo;s a game you can&rsquo;t use any kind
of craft that is plainly a warship in, and the burning
question always is as to how far you will
sacrifice punishing power to harmlessness of appearance.
A light gun or two is about as far as you<!-- Page 217 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
can go in the way of shooting-irons, and even these
are very difficult to conceal on a small boat. Likewise
a torpedo tube. I tried that first stunt of
mine without either, and that&rsquo;s where the psychology
came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the &lsquo;Q-boats&rsquo; they were figuring on at
that time were of the slower freighter type, with
a rather powerful gun mounted for&rsquo;ard and concealed
as well as possible by something rigged up
to look like deck cargo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was, however, all well and good as far
as it went, I figured, but, from such study of the
Hun&rsquo;s little ways as I had been able to make, I had
my doubts as to whether an old cargo boat would
prove tempting enough bait to put a Fritz in the
proper mental state for a real &lsquo;rise&rsquo;&mdash;one in which
he&rsquo;d deliver himself up to you bound and gagged, so
to speak. <i>That</i> was the kind of a thing I wanted
to make a bid for, and, by cracky, I pulled it off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From all I could pick up, from the inside and
outside, about the ships that had already been torpedoed,
I came to the conclusion that the Hun
would go to a lot more trouble, and take a deal
bigger chance, to put down a vessel with a number
of passengers than he would with a freighter. And
even that early in the War a U-boat had exposed
itself to being rammed by a destroyer, when it
could have avoided the attack entirely by foregoing
the pleasure of a Parthian shot at a lifeboat which
was already half-swamped in the heavy seas. <i>That</i><!-- Page 218 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
was the little trait of the Hun&rsquo;s that I reckoned on
playing up to when I began to figure on taking the
&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; out U-boat strafing without any gun larger
than a Maxim aboard her. I&rsquo;d have been glad
enough of a good four-incher, understand, if there
had been any way in the world it could have been
concealed. But there wasn&rsquo;t, and rather than miss
getting into the game at all, I was quite content to
tackle it with such weapons as were available.
That was where my &lsquo;che-ild&rsquo; came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the score of weapons available, there were
only two&mdash;the lance-bomb and the depth-charge.
For the kind of game I had in mind, it was to the
former that I pinned my faith. It was powerful
enough to do all the damage needful to the shell
of a submarine if only a chance to get home with
it could be contrived. &lsquo;Getting it home&rsquo; has always
been the great difficulty with the lance-bomb,
and up to that time the only chap to have any luck
with it was the skipper of a M.L.&mdash;another Yank,
by the way, who came over and got into the game
in the same way, and about the same time, that I
did. He had been the champion sixteen-pound
hammer-thrower in some Middle Western college
only a year or two before, and, by taking a double
turn on his heeling deck, managed to chuck the
bomb (which is on the end of a wooden handle,
much like the old throwing hammer) about three
times as far as anyone ever dreamed of, and cracked
in the nose of a lurking U-boat with it.<!-- Page 219 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Unluckily, I was not a hammer-thrower, and
so had to try to bring about an easier shot. It was
with this purpose in view that I submitted a proposal
to reconvert the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; temporarily to the
outward seeming of a pleasure yacht; to make her
appear so tempting a bait that the Hun&rsquo;s lust for
<i>schrecklichkeit</i>, or whatever they call it, would lure
him close enough to give me a chance at him.
They were rather inclined to scoff at the plan at
first, principally on the ground that the enemy,
knowing that there was no pleasure yachting going
on in the North Sea, would instantly be suspicious
of a craft of that character. I pointed out that
there was still a bit of yachting going on in the
Norfolk Broads, which the Hun, with his comprehensive
knowledge of the East Coast, might well
know of, and that there would be nothing strange
in a craft from there being blown to sea in a spell
of nor&rsquo;west weather. Of course, the &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t
a Broads type by a long way, but I didn&rsquo;t expect
the Hun to linger over fine distinctions any more
than the trout coming up for a fly does. The sequel
fully proved that I was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was largely because the stunt I had in mind
promised to cost little more than a new coat of
paint and a few rehearsals, which could easily be
carried on in the course of our ordinary patrol
duties, that I finally received somewhat grudging
authorisation to go ahead with it. It was not till
the whole show was over that I learned from the<!-- Page 220 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
laughing admission of the officer who helped secure
that authorization, that the fact that the output
of real M.L.&rsquo;s was becoming large enough so
that they were about independent of the use of
yachts and other pleasure craft for patrol work,
also had a good deal to do with the granting
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I already had several well-trained machine-gunners
in the crew, so that about the only addition
I had to make to the ship&rsquo;s company was a
half-dozen boys to masquerade as ladies. As they
were not meant to stand inspection at close range,
nothing elaborate in the way of costume or makeup
was necessary. They wore middy jackets, with
short duck skirts, which gave them plenty of liberty
of action. Most of them (as there was nothing
much below the waist going to show anyway) simply
rolled up their sailor breeches and went barelegged,
and one who went in for white stockings and
tennis shoes was considered rather a swanker.
Their millinery was somewhat variegated, the only
thing in common to the motley units of head-gear
being conspicuousness. There was a much beribboned
broad-brimmed straw, a droopy Panama, a
green and a purple motor veil, and a very chic
yachting effect in a converted cap of a lieutenant
of Marines with a red band round it. Less in keeping,
if more striking, was a Gainsborough, with
magenta ostrich plumes, a remnant from some
&lsquo;ship&rsquo; theatricals.<!-- Page 221 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hair wasn&rsquo;t a very important item, but they
all seemed to take so much pleasure in &lsquo;coiffeuring&rsquo;
that I took good care not to discourage their
efforts in that direction. The spirit that you enter
that kind of a game in makes all the difference in
the world in its success, and these lads&mdash;and, indeed,
the whole lot of us&mdash;were like children playing
house. All of them were blondes&mdash;even a boy
born in Durban, who had more than a touch of the
&lsquo;tar brush,&rsquo; and one&mdash;a roly-poly young Scot, who
had made himself a pair of tawny braids from rope
ravellings&mdash;looked like a cross between &lsquo;Brunnhilde&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Viking&rsquo;s Daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only during rehearsals, of course, that
these lads were &lsquo;ladies of leisure.&rsquo; The rest of the
time I kept them on brass polishing and deck-scrubbing,
with the result that the little old &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
regained, outwardly at least, much of her pristine
ship-shapiness. The &lsquo;gentlemen friends&rsquo; of the
&lsquo;ladies&rsquo; were even more of a &lsquo;make-ship&rsquo; product
than the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, they were really costumes rather than
individuals. I don&rsquo;t mean that we used dummies,
but only that there were eight or ten flannel jackets
and boater hats laid ready, and these were to be
worn more or less indiscriminately by any of the
regular crew not on watch. Their r&ocirc;le was simply
to loll on the quarterdeck with the &lsquo;ladies&rsquo; while
the U-boat was sizing us up, then to join for a few
minutes in the &lsquo;panic&rsquo; following the hoped-for<!-- Page 222 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
attack, and finally to beat it to their action stations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That a &lsquo;baby&rsquo; was by far the most effective
disguise for the first lance-bomb we hoped to chuck
home was obvious at the outset. Both of them
had heads, their general shapes (when dressed)
were not dissimilar, while the &lsquo;long clothes&rsquo; of
the infant was found to have a real steadying effect
on the missile, on the same principle that &lsquo;streamers&rsquo;
act to bring an air-bomb down nose-first. Of
course, a child in arms, like this one was to be,
wasn&rsquo;t just the kind of thing one would take pleasure
yachting; but I knew the Huns took their nurslings
to beer gardens, and thought that that might
make them think that the Englanders&mdash;who were
incomprehensible folk anyhow&mdash;might take this
strange way of accustoming their young to the
waves which they sang so loudly of ruling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The decisive consideration, however, was the
fact a baby was the only thing except a jewel-case
that a panicky woman in fear of being torpedoed
would stick to. As you can&rsquo;t get a lance-bomb
in a jewel-case, it was plainly &lsquo;baby&rsquo; or nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the end, because I was afraid that none of
the feminine make-ups was quite good enough not
to awaken suspicion at close range&mdash;I decided that
the heaving over of the &lsquo;baby&rsquo; should be done by
a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; instead of by a &lsquo;lady.&rsquo; As one of
the seamen put it, it was only &lsquo;nateral that the<!-- Page 223 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
nipper&rsquo;s daddy &rsquo;ud be lookin&rsquo; arter &rsquo;im in time of
danger,&rsquo; and I had read of sailors being entrusted
with children on sinking ships. The man I picked
for the job&mdash;the &lsquo;father of the che-ild,&rsquo; as he soon
came to be called&mdash;was not the one who had proved
the best in distance throwing in the trials, but
rather one on whose cold-blooded nerve I knew I
could count in any extremity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a Seaman Gunner, named R&mdash;&mdash;, and
was lost a year ago when a rather desperate &lsquo;Q&rsquo;
stunt he had volunteered for miscarried. He had
just the touch of the histrionic desirable for the intimate
little affair in question, and the way he
played his part fully justified my selecting him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>K&mdash;&mdash; leaned back in his chair and blew smoke
rings for a minute before resuming his story.
&ldquo;There are some kind of stunts, like this one I&rsquo;ve
been trying to bring off for the last two or three
months,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that always seem to hang fire;
and there are others where, from first to last, everything
comes up to the scratch on time, just like a
film drama. That first one I&rsquo;m telling you about
was like that, everybody&mdash;even to the U-boat&mdash;coming
on to its cue. Indeed, when I think of it
now, the whole show seems more like a big movie
than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time we were letter perfect in our parts,
there came two or three days of just the kind of a
storm I wanted to make a good excuse for a dinky
little pleasure boat being out in the middle of the
North Sea. I took care, of course, to be &lsquo;blown&rsquo;<!-- Page 224 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to the last position at which an enemy submarine
had been reported.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, where a destroyer or a M.L. might have
cruised round for a month without sighting anything
but fog and the smoke of some of our own
ships on the horizon, we picked up a Fritz running
brazenly on the surface the first morning. That
was first blood for my harmless appearance right
there, for he must have seen us some time previously
of course, and had we looked in the least warlike,
would have submerged before even our lookout
spotted his conning-tower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it was, he simply began closing us at full
speed, firing as he came. It was rotten shooting at
first, as shooting from the very poor platform a submarine
affords usually is, but, at about three thousand
yards, he put a shell through the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo;,
luckily above the water-line. The next minute or
two was the most anxious time I had, for, if he
made up his mind to do it that way, there was
nothing to prevent his sticking off there and putting
us down with shell-fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if the two or three shots which followed
had been hits, that is what he would have
done. It was probably his disgust at the fact that
they were all &lsquo;overs&rsquo; that determined him to close
in and finish the job with bombs. Possibly, also,
the fact that I appeared to be starting to abandon
ship at this juncture convinced him finally that the
yacht had no fight in her, and it may well be that<!-- Page 225 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the temptation to loot had something to do with
his decision. I could never make quite sure on
those points, for Herr Skipper never confided what
was in his mind to the one officer who survived him.
At any rate, he came nosing nonchalantly in and
did just what I had been praying for the last month
he would do&mdash;poked right up alongside. The heavy
sea that had been running for the last two or three
days had gone down during the night, so that he
was able to stand in pretty close without running
much danger of bumping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The extent of my abandoning ship had been to
follow the old sea rule of saving the women and
children first. Or rather, we put the women off in
our only boat; the baby, I won&rsquo;t need to tell you,
was somehow &lsquo;overlooked.&rsquo; The boat was lowered
in full view of the Hun, who was about fifteen
hundred yards distant at the moment, and there
was a little unrehearsed incident in connection
with it that must have done its part in convincing
him that what he was witnessing was a genuine
piece of &lsquo;abandon.&rsquo; One of the girls&mdash;it was the
blonde &lsquo;Brunnhilde,&rsquo; I believe&mdash;not wanting to miss
any of the fun, started to hang back and tried to
bluff them into letting her stay by swearing that
she&rsquo;d rather face the Hun than desert her child.
As a matter of fact, the &lsquo;Gainsborough&rsquo; had more
claim on the kid than &lsquo;Brunnhilde,&rsquo; for she&mdash;I
mean he&mdash;had cadged its clothes from a sweetheart
who worked in a draper&rsquo;s shop. If I had been there<!-- Page 226 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
personally, I&rsquo;m afraid &lsquo;Brunnhilde&rsquo;s&rsquo; little bluff
would have won through, for a man whose wits are
keen enough to spring a joke at a crisis has always
made an especial appeal to me. To the bo&rsquo;sun,
however, orders were orders, and his answer to
the recalcitrant blonde&rsquo;s insubordination was to
rush her to the rail by the slack of her middy
jacket, and to help her over it with the toe of his
boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;K&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s&rsquo; low freeboard made the drop a
short one, and, luckily, &lsquo;Brunnhilde&rsquo; missed the
gun&rsquo;nel&rsquo; of the whaler and landed gently in the
water, from where she was dragged by the ready
hands of her sisters a few moments later. They do
say, though, that she turned a complete flip-flop in
the air, and that there was a display of&mdash;well, if a
Goerz prism binocular won&rsquo;t reveal the difference
between a pair of blue sailor&rsquo;s breeches and French
lingerie at under a mile, all I can say is that we&rsquo;ve
much overrated German optical glass. As I learned
later, however, the Huns, observing only the fall
and missing the revealing details, merely concluded
that the Englanders were jumping overboard
in panic, and dismissed their last lingering
doubts and suspicions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls were already instructed that they
were to lie low and keep their peroxide curls out of
sight as long as they were within a mile or so of
the submarine, so as not to tempt the latter to follow
them up for a look-see at closer range. The<!-- Page 227 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
boat had orders to pull astern for a while, and then,
if the Hun was observed to come alongside the
&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; as hoped, to turn eight or ten points to port
and head up in the direction from which he had
appeared. The reason for this man&oelig;uvre, which
was carried out precisely as planned, you will
understand in a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On came Fritz, coolly contemptuous, and on
went the show, like the unrolling of a movie scenario.
For a while I was fearful that he might order
back my boat to use in boarding me with, but as
soon as he was close enough to be sure that I had
no gun he must have decided so much trouble was
superfluous. He had only one gun, it was evident&mdash;the
gunners kept sweeping it back and forth to
cover from about the bridge to the engine-room as
they drew nearer&mdash;and presently I saw men, armed
with short rifles, coming up through both fore and
after hatches. Far from exhibiting any signs of
belligerency, I still kept three or four of my &rsquo;flannelled
fools&rsquo; mildly panicking. Or, rather, I
<i>ordered</i> them to panic mildly. As a matter of fact,
they did it rather violently&mdash;a good deal more like
movie rough stuff than the real thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little difference it made to Fritz, though, who
seemed to take it quite as a matter of course that
the British yachtsman should show his terror like
a Wild West film drama heroine. On he stood, and
when he came within hailing distance, a burly
ruffian on the bridge&mdash;doubtless the skipper&mdash;shouted<!-- Page 228 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
something in guttural German-English
which I never quite made out, but which was probably
some kind of warning or other. I don&rsquo;t think
I saw any of my crew exactly &lsquo;Kamerading&rsquo;, but
I needn&rsquo;t tell you that every man in sight was doing
his best to register &lsquo;troubled passivity&rsquo;, or something
like that. I had anticipated that I might not
be in a position to signal his cue to R&mdash;&mdash;, and so
had arranged that he should keep watch from a
cabin port, and to use his own judgment about the
time of his &lsquo;entrance.&rsquo; I was afraid to have him on
deck all the time for fear the &lsquo;che-ild&rsquo; might be subjected
to too careful a scrutiny. R&mdash;&mdash; was just in
flannels, understand, so there was nothing suspicious
in his own appearance. He did both his
play-acting and his real acting to perfection, neither
overdoing nor underdoing one or the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The U-boat was close alongside, rapidly easing
down under reversed propellers, before R&mdash;&mdash; appeared,
just as natural an anguished father with a
child as you could possibly ask for. Two or three
of the Huns covered him with their carbines as he
dashed out of the port door of the saloon&mdash;that
one just behind you&mdash;but lowered the muzzles
again when they saw it was apparently only a half-distracted
parent trying to signal for the boat to
come back for him and his babe. I have no doubt
that there were some very sarcastic remarks passed
on that U-boat at this juncture about the courage of
the English male. <i>If</i> there were, the next act of<!-- Page 229 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the coolest and bravest boy I ever knew literally
forced the words down their throats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whaler which, following its instructions,
had been pulling easterly for some minutes, now
bore about four points on the port quarter, so that
R&mdash;&mdash;, in his apparent endeavour to call its attention
to the deserted babe, could not have seemed to
have been doing anything suspicious when he swung
the bundle above his head and rushed to the rail
almost opposite the U-boat&rsquo;s conning-tower. That
rotary upward and backward swing was absolutely
necessary for getting distance with, and without it
there was no way that forty or fifty pound infant
could have been hurled the fifteen feet or more
which still intervened. As it was, it landed, fair
and square, in the angle formed by the after end
of the conning-tower and the deck. At the same
instant our machine-guns opened up through several
of the port scuttles, which had been specially
enlarged and masked with that end in view, and in
a few seconds there was not an unwounded Hun
in sight. The gunners had been the first ones
sprayed, with the result that they were copped
before firing a shot. Their torpedoes, or course,
were too close, and not bearing properly enough
to launch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Immediately following the explosion of the
bomb and the opening of the machine-gun fire a
strange thing happened. I saw the U-boat&rsquo;s bow-rudders
begin to slant, saw her begin to gather way,<!-- Page 230 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
heard the hum of motors as the rattle of the Maxims
(their work completed) died out, and&mdash;down
she went, and with three hatches open, and a ragged
hole abaft the conning-tower where the &lsquo;baby&rsquo; had
exploded in its final tantrum. I could never get
any sure explanation of this from any of the survivors
we fished up out of the water, but everything
points to the probability that the skipper&mdash;perhaps
inadvertently, as the up-kick of the bomb blew him
overboard&mdash;pulled the diving klaxon, and the officer
in the central control room, not knowing just
how things stood above, proceeded to submerge as
usual. Doubtless the men who should have been
standing by to close the hatches in such an emergency
had been caught by the machine-gun fire.
With every man below tied down with his duties in
connection with submerging her, it is quite conceivable
that nothing could be done, once she was below
the surface, to stop the inrush of water, and that
she was quickly beyond all hope of bringing up
again. I didn&rsquo;t have a fair chance to size up the
hole ripped open by the bomb, but rather think that
also was large enough to have admitted a good deal
of water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was rather disappointing in a way, having
her go down like that, for as things had turned out,
it was a hundred to one we should otherwise have
captured her almost unharmed. There was a good
deal of solace, however, in the fact that none of the
Huns were getting back to tell what happened to<!-- Page 231 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
them, so that this identical stunt was left open for
use again. As a matter of fact, variations of it
were used a number of times, by one kind of craft
or another, before an unlucky slip-up&mdash;the one
which finished poor R&mdash;&mdash;, by the way&mdash;gave the
game away and started us veering off on other
tacks. I have had a number of successes since that
time,&rdquo; concluded K&mdash;&mdash;, pouring me a glass of the
yacht&rsquo;s 1835 Cognac as a night cap, &ldquo;but never a
one which was quite so much like taking candy from
a child as that &lsquo;opener.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE <i>WHACK</i> AND THE <i>SMACK</i></h3>


<p>There was always a strange and distinctive
fascination to me in standing on the bridge
of one ship and watching other ships&mdash;and
especially lines of ships&mdash;push up and sharpen to
shape above the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>This feeling, strong enough in ordinary times&mdash;when
it was but a peaceful merchantman one
watched from and but peaceful merchantmen that
one saw&mdash;is intensified manifold when it is a warship&rsquo;s
bridge one paces, and only the silhouettes of
ships of war that notch the far horizon. Battleship,
battle cruiser, light cruiser, destroyer, sloop, trawler,
and all the other kinds and classes of patrol
craft&mdash;each has its own distinctive smudge of
smoke, its own peculiar way of revealing its identity
by a blurred foretop, funnel, or superstructure long
before its hull has lifted its amorphous mass above
the sky-line.</p>

<p>And now to the sky-line riddles one was given to
read, and to be thrilled by as the puzzle revealed
itself, had been added the great troop convoy from
America, my first sight of one of which was just unfolding.
H.M.S. <i>Buzz</i>, in which I chanced to be<!-- Page 233 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
out at the time, was not one of the escorting
destroyers, and it was only by accident that the
course she was steering to join up with a couple of
other ships of her flotilla on some kind of &ldquo;hunting&rdquo;
stunt took her across that of the convoy, and
passed it in inspiring panoramic review before our
eyes. From dusky blurs of smoke trailing low along
the horizon, ship after ship&mdash;from ex-floating
palaces with famous names to angular craft of
strange design which were evidently the latest
word in standardised construction&mdash;they rose out
of the sea (as our quartering course brought us
nearer) until a wide angle of our seaward view was
blocked by an almost solid wall of steadily steaming
steel.</p>

<p>There was a lot to stir the imagination in that
sight&mdash;aye, fairly to grip you by the throat as a
dawning sense of what it portended sank home. In
the abstract it was the living, breathing symbol of
the relentless progress of America&rsquo;s mighty effort,
a tangible sign of the fact that her aid to the Allies
would not arrive too late. What it stood for concretely
is best expressed in the words of the young
R.N.R. sub-lieutenant who was officer of the watch
at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; he said, with a pleased smile,
as he lowered his glass after a long scrutiny of the
advancing lines of ships, &ldquo;as though there&rsquo;d be
jolly near forty thousand new Yanks to be catered
for in Liverpool by to-morrow evening.&rdquo;<!-- Page 234 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said somewhat dubiously, my mind suddenly
assailed by a misgiving awakened by the
thousands of yards of torpedo target presented by
the sides of those placidly ploughing ships, &ldquo;that
is, assuming that they get there safely. But they&rsquo;re
only just entering the danger zone now, and there&rsquo;s
a lot of water got to stream under their keels before
they berth in the Mersey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about convoys, or the
ways of protecting them; but all the same, it looks
to me as though that bunch of troopers would offer
a mark like the map of Ireland to a U-boat, and a
lot more vulnerable one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young P&mdash;&mdash; laughed as he bent, squint-eyed, to
take a bearing on a destroyer zigzagging jauntily
with high-flung wake in the van of the approaching
fleet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what everyone&mdash;even an old sailor&mdash;says
the first time he sights one of the big transatlantic
convoys,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if there are any
skippers new to the job in that lot there, that&rsquo;s just
what <i>they&rsquo;re</i> saying. It&rsquo;s all through failure to
appreciate&mdash;indeed, no one who has not seen the ins
and outs of it would be in a position to appreciate&mdash;the
effectiveness of the whole anti-submarine
scheme, and, especially, what almost complete protection
thoroughly up-to-the-minute screening&mdash;with
adequate destroyers and other light craft&mdash;really
affords. As a matter of fact, every soldier in
that convoy is probably a good deal safer now&mdash;and<!-- Page 235 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
right on in through this so-called danger zone
to harbour&mdash;than he was marching down Broadway
to the pier&mdash;at least, if Broadway is like it
was when I used to put in to New York as a kid
in the <i>Baltic</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But will you tell me,&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;how a
U-boat, firing two or three torpedoes from, say, just
about where we are now, could possibly miss a mark
like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it would take a bit of missing from hereabouts,
I admit,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;only, if there is
any Fritz still in the game with the nerve to try it,
he would also be missing himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would happen to him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One or all of two or three things might happen,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; P&mdash;&mdash; answered,
after ordering a point or
two alteration in course to give safe berth to the
nearing destroyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might get his hide holed by gunfire, he
might get split open by a depth-charge, he might
get rammed, and he might get several other things.
With all the luck in his favour, he might even get
a transport. But there&rsquo;s one thing I can assure
you he wouldn&rsquo;t get&mdash;and that&rsquo;s back to his base.
There may be two or three bearings from which
one of these big convoys appears to present a
mark as wide and unbroken as the map of Ireland;
but there&rsquo;s nothing in heaven or earth to save the
Fritz who hasn&rsquo;t learned by the sad example of no<!-- Page 236 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
small number of his mates that it is quick suicide
for him to slip a mouldie down one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that he doesn&rsquo;t try it? that he&rsquo;s
afraid to take the chance?&rdquo; I asked somewhat incredulously,
for I had somehow come to regard
Fritz, though a pirate, as a dashing and daring one
when the stake was high enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except under very favourable circumstances,
yes,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and now that, with the coming
of the American destroyers and patrol boats,
we are able to do the thing the way we want to,
what Fritz might reckon as &lsquo;very favourable circumstances&rsquo;
are becoming increasingly fewer and
farther between. Now a few months ago, when
we were just getting the convoy system under weigh,
and when there was a shortage of every kind of
screening craft, things were different. Fritz&rsquo;s
<i>moral</i> was better then than it is now, and we didn&rsquo;t
have the means of shaking it that we have piled up
since. At our first convoys, straggling and little
schooled in looking after themselves, he used to
take a chance as often as not, if he happened to sight
them; but even then he rarely got back to tell what
happened to him. There was the one that tried to
celebrate the advent of &lsquo;Peace-on-Earth-Good-Will-to-Men&rsquo;
last Christmas Day by sinking the <i>Amperi</i>,
which was one of a convoy the <i>Whack</i> (in which I
was Number Two at the time) was helping to
escort. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t say much for his &lsquo;Good-Will-toward-Men,&rsquo;
but he certainly found a short<!-- Page 237 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
cut to &lsquo;Peace-on-Earth,&rsquo; or at least the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that chap took a real sporting chance, and
got his reward for it&mdash;both ways. I mean to say,
that he sunk the ship he went after all right&mdash;which
was his reward one way; and that we then sunk him&mdash;which
was his reward the other way. There was
a funny coincidence in connection with that little
episode which might amuse you. We were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment while he spelled out for
himself the &ldquo;Visual&rdquo; which one of the escorting
destroyers was flashing to the convoy leader, but
presently, with a smile of pleased reminiscence,
took up the thread of his yarn. This is the story
that young Sub-Lieutenant P&mdash;&mdash;, R.N.R., told me
the while we leaned on the lee rail of the bridge
and watched the passing of those miles-long lines
of packed troopers as, silently sure of purpose, superbly
contemptuous of danger, they steamed steadily
on to deliver their cargoes of human freight one
step further towards the fulfilment of its destiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Christmas Day, as I told you,&rdquo; he said,
bracing comfortable against the roll, &ldquo;and a cold,
blustering, windy day it was. Several days previously
we had picked up a small slow convoy off a
West African port, and were escorting it to a port
on the West Coast of England. The escort consisted
only of the <i>Whack</i> and the <i>Smack</i>, the skipper
of the latter, as the senior officer, being in command.
None of the ships&mdash;they were mostly slow<!-- Page 238 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
freighters&mdash;had had much convoy experience to
speak of at the time, and we were having our hands
full all the way keeping them in any kind of formation.
They seemed to be getting worse rather than
better in this respect as we got into the waters
where U-boat attacks might be expected, but this
may have been largely due to the weather, which
was&mdash;well, about the usual mid-winter brand in
those latitudes. In fact, we were just becoming
hopeful that the rising wind and sea, both were
about &lsquo;Force 6,&rsquo; might make it impossible for submarines
to operate during the day or so that still
must elapse before reaching port, when trouble
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the morning the <i>Plato</i>, which had been a
bad straggler throughout, had been falling astern,
and finally the <i>Smack</i> ordered <i>Whack</i> back to prod
her on and do what could be done in the way of
screening her. She still continued to lose distance,
however, so that, at noon, we were nearly out of
sight of the main convoy, of which little more than
smoke and topmasts could be seen on the northern
horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that hour the <i>Smack</i>, doubtless because
he had received some report of the presence of
U-boats in his vicinity, ordered us to rejoin the
convoy. We left an armed trawler to do what it
could for the loitering <i>Plato</i>, and started off at the
best rate the weather would allow to make up the
distance lost. It was at this juncture that the<!-- Page 239 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
amusing little coincidence I mentioned a while ago
occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A patrol-boat, of course, does not carry a padre,
any more than it does a number of the other comforts
and luxuries provided in cruisers and battleships,
and for that reason we hadn&rsquo;t been able to
do very much in the way of a Christmas service.
Several of the ship&rsquo;s company were somewhat religiously
inclined, however, and these, in lieu of
anything better, had asked for and received permission
to hold a bit of a song service, in case there
was opportunity for it, during the day. As the
morning had been a rather full one, no suitable interval
offered until their rather poor apology
for a Christmas dinner was out of the way, and
we were headed back to join the convoy. Then they
went to it with a will, and for the next hour or
more fragments of Yuletide songs came drifting
back to my cabin to mingle with a number of other
things conspiring to disturb the forty winks I
was trying to snatch while the going was good.
After a while, it appears, having run through their
repertoire of Christmas songs, they started in on
Easter ones, &lsquo;Bein&rsquo; that they was mo&rsquo; or less on
the same subject,&rsquo; as one of them explained to me
later. They had just boomed the last line of a
chorus which concluded with &lsquo;We shall seek our
risen Lord,&rsquo; when a signal was received stating that
a periscope had been sighted by some ship of the
convoy, and, sure enough, off they had to go to<!-- Page 240 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
seek&mdash;well, I wouldn&rsquo;t take the Hun quite so near
his own valuation of himself to put it as the song
does, but all the same that quick new kick of the
screws told me as plain as any words, even before
I read the signal, that the old <i>Whack</i> was jumping
away to seek <i>something</i> that had risen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The convoy was dead ahead of us at a distance
of about seven miles when I reached the bridge,
and, the visibility being unusually good for that
time of year, I could see all of the ships distinctly,
as they steamed in two columns of three abreast.
I was even able to recognise the <i>Amperi</i> in the centre
of the leading line. We were just comforting
each other with the assurance that it was getting
too rough for a U-boat to run a torpedo with any
chance of finding its mark, when a huge spout of
water jumped skyward right in the middle of the
convoy. When it subsided, the <i>Amperi</i>, with a
heavy list to port, could be seen heading westward,
evidently with her engines and steering gear disabled,
while the rest of the convoy, smoke rolling
from their funnels, were &lsquo;starring&rsquo; on northerly
courses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The alarm was rung, and as the men rushed to
action stations a signal was made to the <i>Smack</i>
asking what was wrong. She replied, &lsquo;<i>Amperi</i>
torpedoed; join me with all dispatch.&rsquo; This, of
course, we had already started to do, though the
wind and sea were knocking a good many knots off
our best speed. It was evident enough that the<!-- Page 241 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
<i>Amperi</i> had received a death-blow, so that we were
not surprised to find them abandoning ship as we
began to close her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rotten as the weather was for it, this was
being conducted most coolly and skilfully, and three
boats had already left her before we came driving
down to her assistance. <i>Smack</i> had signalled us
to pick up survivors, and we had stood in, at reduced
speed, to 250 yards of the now heavily heeling
ship, with the intention of proceeding on down,
to the leeward of her to the aid of two of her boats,
when we sighted three or four feet of periscope
sticking out of the water, one point on the starboard
bow and at a distance of about a couple of
hundred yards. To see anything at all in rough
water like that, you understand, a periscope has to
be poked well above the slap of the waves, and
that about equalizes the greater difficulty there is
in picking up the &lsquo;feather&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s choppy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at my action station with the 12-pounder
batteries at this juncture, but as it looked like a
better chance for the depth-charges than the guns,
no order to open fire was given just yet. The captain
ordered the helm to be steadied, and rang up
&lsquo;Full speed ahead&rsquo; to the engine-room. We passed
the periscope ten yards on the port side, and when
the stern was just coming abreast it, two charges
were released together. As they were both set for
the same depth it is probable that the one staggeringly
powerful explosion we felt was caused by<!-- Page 242 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
their detonating simultaneously. The shock was as
solid as though we had struck a rock, and I could
feel a distinct lift to the ship before the impact of
it. There was something so substantially satisfying
about that muffled jar that it seemed only in the
natural course of things that it effected what it was
intended to. The bow of the U-boat broke surface
almost immediately, the fact that it showed before
the conning-tower proving at once that she was
hard hit and heavily down by the stern. Indeed, the
deck of her from the conning-tower aft was fated
never again to feel the rush of sea air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was now less than a hundred yards right
astern of us, and heading, in a wobbly sort of way,
like a half-stunned porpoise floundering away from
the &lsquo;boil&rsquo; of a depth-charge, on just about the
course the <i>Whack</i> had been on when she kicked
loose her &lsquo;cans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skipper put the helm hard-a-starboard,
with the idea of turning to ram, at the same time
ordering me to open fire with the port twelve-pounder.
That was what I had been waiting for.
The gun-crew was down to three&mdash;through the
others having been detailed for boat work in connection
with picking up the survivors from the
<i>Amperi</i>&mdash;but that didn&rsquo;t bother a good deal in a
short and sweet practice like this one. The ship
was bobbing like a cork from the seas, in addition to
her heavy heel from the short turn and the vibration
from the grind of the helm. But neither did
any of these little things matter materially, for<!-- Page 243 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
we&rsquo;d always made a point of carrying out our target
practice under the worst conditions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first round, fired at three hundred yards,
was an &lsquo;over&rsquo; by a narrow margin, but the second,
at two hundred yards, was a clean hit on the conning-tower,
carrying away the periscope and the
stays supporting it. The explosion of this shell
appeared to split the whole superstructure of the
conning-tower, from the bridge to the deck. I did
not see anyone on the bridge at this moment, and if
there had been he must certainly have been killed.
The fact that the submarine seemed to have been
blown to the surface by the force of our exploding
depth-charges rather than to have come up voluntarily,
may account for the fact that no head was
poked above the bridge rail as she emerged. If
she had come up deliberately it would have been
the duty of the skipper and a signalman to pop out
on to the bridge at once to be ready for eventualities.
Evidently they had no chance to do so on this
occasion, and as a consequence spun out their
thread o&rsquo; life by anywhere from twenty to thirty
seconds&mdash;whatever that was worth to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My third shot plumped into her abaft the conning-tower,
and the explosion which followed it had
a good deal more behind it than the charge of a
twelve-pounder shell. Before I had a chance to see
what had blown up, however, we had rammed her,
and whatever damage that shot had caused dissolved<!-- Page 244 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
in the chaos of what proved the real <i>coup de
gr&acirc;ce</i>. That ramming was undoubtedly one of the
prettiest little jobs of its kind, one of the most
neatly finessed, ever brought off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since running over the submarine and dropping
the depth-charges the captain had turned the
<i>Whack</i> through thirty-two points, a complete circle.
This brought her back to a course just at
right angles to the beam of the now helpless enemy,
toward which she was driven to the limit of the last
kick of the engines. Just before the moment of
impact the screws were stopped dead, so as to sink
the bow and reduce the chance of riding over the
U-boat and rolling it under her stem, as has occasionally
happened, instead of cutting it straight in
two. The jar, when it came, was terrific, throwing
from his feet every man not holding to something;
yet there was that in the clean, sweet crunch of it
that told me that it had accomplished all the heart
could desire, even before the next second furnished
graphic ocular evidence of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sharp, fine bows of the <i>Whack</i> drove home
well abaft the conning-tower, and&mdash;though the
staggering jar told of the resistance met&mdash;for all
the eye could see, cut through like a knife in soft
butter. Indeed, the amazing cleanness of the cut
has always seemed to me the most remarkable feature
of the whole show. The bow end of the U-boat,
with the conning-tower, was the section which was
cut off on my side&mdash;port&mdash;and the even cross-section<!-- Page 245 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
of it that gaped up at me was very little different
from that I once saw when one of our own submarines
was being sawed through amidships in
connection with some repairs. Even the plating
did not appear to be bent or buckled. The impression
that ring of shining clean-cloven steel left on
my mind was of a cut as true and even as could have
been done in dock with an acetylene flame. This
was largely imagination, of course; and yet how
photographic my mind-picture is you may judge
from the fact that I have distinct recollection of
seeing the thin circle of red lead where it showed all
the way round beneath the grey of the outer paint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The heavily tilted main deck of the interior of
this section of the U-boat did not appear to be
flooded at this juncture, though any water that had
been shipped, of course, would have been in the now
submerged bows. I have a jumbled recollection of
wheels and levers and switchboards, fittings of
brass and steel, and what I took to be three torpedoes&mdash;one
on the port side, and two, one above
the other, on the starboard. The most arresting
thing of all, however, was the figure of a solitary
man, the only one, strange to say, that anybody
reports having seen. He was scrambling upward
toward the opening, and I have never been quite
sure whether he was &lsquo;Kamerad-ing&rsquo; with his uplifted
hands, or whether they were raised preparatory
to the dive it is quite probable he intended to
make into the sea.<!-- Page 246 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whichever the attitude was, it had no chance
to serve its purpose. The stern section of the U-boat&mdash;the
one most heavily damaged by the depth-charges&mdash;was
seen to sink abreast the starboard
12-pounder battery by the crew of that gun, but the
forward part&mdash;the one with the conning-tower,
which I had seen into the interior of&mdash;buoyed up
by the water-tight compartments in the bows, continued
to float. Observing this, the Captain ordered
the helm put a-starboard, and as we turned,
the 4-inch gun and my 12-pounder opened up together.
My very first round, fired over the port
quarter, hit and exploded fairly inside the gaping
end of the section, right where I had last seen the
man with upraised hands. That, and the two or
three smashing hits by the 4-inch gun, finished the
job. A whirlpool in the sea marked the rush of
water into the severed end, and this section&mdash;for all
the world as though it had been a complete submarine&mdash;tossed
its bows, with their elephant-ear-like
rudders, skyward, and planed off on an easy
angle toward the bottom. Its disappearance was
complete. There were no survivors, and practically
no floating wreckage. Only a spreading film
of oil and a tangle of torn wakes slowly dissolving
in the wash of the driving seas marked the scene of
the action. It had lasted something over ten
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Whack</i> suffered considerable damage from
the impact with the submarine, though not enough<!-- Page 247 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
to give us serious worry, even in so heavy a sea.
The stem was bent over to port, like a broken nose,
and the buckling plates caused her to make quite a
bit of water. We had no trouble coping with this,
however, and made port, with the survivors of the
<i>Amperi</i> aboard, without difficulty. There we soon
had the&mdash;well, not unmixedly unpleasant&mdash;news
that the <i>Whack&rsquo;s</i> wounds were of a nature somewhat
comparable to what the Tommy in France
calls a &lsquo;Blighty.&rsquo; Without having any real permanent
harm done her, she was still enough
banged up to need a special refit, the period of
which, of course, the most of us would be able to
spend at home on leave. Yes, indeed,&rdquo; he concluded,
grinning pleasedly, &ldquo;that was a ripping
piece of ramming in more ways than one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>P&mdash;&mdash; went over and bent above the shivering
&ldquo;Gyro,&rdquo; for a moment, took a long look through his
glasses at the last of the now receding convoy, and
then came back and rejoined me by the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one little thing I neglected to tell
you about,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;and that was the
part the <i>Smack</i> played in that show. Although the
<i>Whack</i> got all the <i>kudos</i> for the sinking, there is a
decided possibility that a bit of a stunt the <i>Smack</i>
brought off before ever we came up may have been
largely if not entirely responsible for us getting the
chance we did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Smack</i>, you see, was near at hand when the <i>Amperi</i>
was torpedoed, and the instant her Captain<!-- Page 248 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
saw the spout of water shoot up in the air, he
altered course and drove at full speed for the point
he reckoned the submarine would be most likely to
be encountered. He reports that he had the good
fortune to hit it, while it was still submerged, and
that the shock was severe enough to throw men off
their balance. Shortly after that a periscope appeared,
and it was this that gave the <i>Whack</i> her
chance to drop her depth-charges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, not unnaturally, the Captain of the
<i>Smack</i> had good reason to believe that his striking
the U-boat, even if he only grazed her, had something
to do with her reappearance on the surface
at a moment when she must have known a strenuous
hunt for her was in progress. Unluckily, for
his claim, however, the bows of the <i>Smack</i>, when
she came to be docked, did not show sufficient evidences
of having been in heavy collision to warrant
the conclusion that the U-boat had been enough
damaged to have gone to the surface from that
cause alone. Under the circumstances, therefore,
there wasn&rsquo;t anything else to do but give the credit
for bringing her up to <i>Whack&rsquo;s</i> depth-charges,
while of course, the fact that it was also the <i>Whack</i>
that rammed her was obvious enough. The consequence
was, as I said, that <i>we</i> got all the <i>kudos</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gazed for a few moments at the back-curling
bow-wave, before resuming. &ldquo;Yes, <i>we</i> got all the
<i>kudos</i>,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;but, all the same, I&rsquo;ve
never been able to figure why Fritz didn&rsquo;t douse his<!-- Page 249 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
periscope and try to dive deeper when he saw the
<i>Whack</i> rounding toward him, if it wasn&rsquo;t because
there was something pretty radically wrong with
him already. I can&rsquo;t help thinking that the old
<i>Smack</i> had a lot to do with starting that Fritz on
his downward path, even if it was the <i>Whack</i> that
gave him the final shove.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was very characteristic, that last little explanation
of P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s. If there is one thing more than
another that has impressed me in hearing these
young British destroyer officers tell the &ldquo;little
games they have played with Fritz,&rdquo; it is the fine
sporting spirit in which they invariably insist in
sharing the credit of an achievement with every
other officer, and man, and ship that has in any way
figured in the action. It was the fault of the Hun
that we could no longer treat the enemy as we
would an opponent in sport; but that only makes
it all the more inspiring to see the fellow-players
still keeping alive the old spirit among themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>BOMBED!</h3>


<p>It was generally admitted by flying-men, even
before the failure of the attempts to destroy
the <i>Goeben</i> while ashore in the Dardanelles
early in &rsquo;18, that the air-bomb was a most uncertain
and ineffective weapon against a large ship of any
class, but especially so against a warship with deck
armour.</p>

<p>The principal reason for this is that the blunt-nosed
air-bomb, no matter from how high it may be
dropped, has neither the velocity nor the structure
to penetrate the enclosed spaces of a ship where its
explosive charge would find something to exert
itself against.</p>

<p>This is why an 18-pounder shell, penetrating to a
casemate or engine-room, for instance, may easily
do more damage to a warship than an air-bomb of
ten times that weight expending its force more or
less harmlessly upon an upper deck.</p>

<p>Merchant ships, with their inflammable and comparatively
flimsy upper works, are more vulnerable
to air-bombs than are warships, but even of these<!-- Page 251 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
very few indeed have been completely destroyed as
a consequence of aerial attack. Some of the gamest
fights of the war on the sea have been those of
merchant skippers who, in the days before their
ships had guns of any description to keep aircraft
at a distance, brought their vessels through by the
exercise of the boundless resource which characterises
their kind, usually by sheer skill in man&oelig;uvring.
A very remarkable instance of this character
I heard of a few days ago from a Royal Naval
Reserve officer who figured in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in a British ship temporarily in the Holland-South
American service at the time,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and we were outward bound from Rotterdam
after discharging a cargo of wheat from Montevideo.
It was before the Huns had raised any objection
to ships bound for Dutch ports using the
direct route by the English Channel, and also before
the U-boats had begun to sink neutrals on
that run. Except for the comparatively slight risk
of encountering a floating mine, we reckoned we
were just about as safe in the North Sea as in the
South Atlantic. Of course, we carried no gun of
any kind&mdash;no heavy gun, I mean. We <i>did</i> have
a rifle or two, as I will tell you of presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the attack was made we never had any
definite explanation. In fact, the Germans themselves
probably never knew, for they tumbled over
themselves to assure the Holland Government that
there was some misunderstanding, and that they<!-- Page 252 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
would undertake that nothing of the kind should
occur again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My personal opinion has always been that it
was a sheer case of running amuck on the part of
the Hun aviator responsible for the outrage; for,
as I have said, we were empty of cargo, our marks
were unmistakable, and we were steering a course
several points off the one usually followed by the
Dutch boats to England. Anyway, he paid the full
penalty for his descent to barbarism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a clear afternoon, with a light wind and
lighter sea, and we were steaming comfortably
along at about nine knots, heading for the Straits
of Dover, when the look-out at the mast-head reported
a squadron of &rsquo;planes approaching from the
south.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently we sighted them from the bridge&mdash;five
seaplanes, three or four points off our starboard
bow. There had been reports of noonday
raids on Calais for several days, and I surmised
that those were Hun machines returning from some
such stunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holding to an even course, the squadron
passed over a mile or more to the starboard of us,
and it was already some distance astern when I
saw one of the machines&mdash;I think it was the one
leading the &lsquo;V&rsquo;&mdash;detach itself from the others and
head swiftly back in our direction. There was
nothing out of the way in this action at a time when
every ship was held in more or less suspicion by<!-- Page 253 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
both belligerents, and it seemed to me so right and
proper that the chap should come and have a look
at us, in case he had some doubts, that I did not
even think it necessary to call the &lsquo;Old Man&rsquo; to
the bridge, or even send him word of what I took
to be no more than a passing incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Descending swiftly as he approached, the Hun
passed over the ship diagonally&mdash;from port
quarter to starboard bow&mdash;at a height of six or
eight hundred feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll end it,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Our marks, and
the fact that we&rsquo;re in ballast, ought to satisfy him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no. Back he came. This time he was a
hundred feet or so lower, and flying on a line
directly down our course, passing over us from bow
to stern. Again he swung round and repeated the
man&oelig;uvre in reverse, this time at a height of not
more than four hundred feet. He had done this
five or six times before it occurred to me that he
was taking practice sights for bombing; but not
even then, when I saw him with his eye glued to his
dropping-instrument, did it occur to me that he
was doing anything more than trying his sights.
It was at the next &lsquo;run&rsquo; or two that the thing began
to get on my nerves, and I called up the skipper on
the voice-pipe and told him I did not quite like the
look of the circus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Old Man was in the middle of his afternoon
siesta, but he tumbled out and came puffing
up to the bridge at the double. He was no more<!-- Page 254 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
inclined to take the thing seriously than I was,
but, on the off-chance&mdash;which your careful skipper
is always thinking of in the back of his brain-box&mdash;he
rang up &lsquo;More steam&rsquo; on the engine-room telegraph,
and ordered the quartermaster to start zig-zagging,
a stunt we had already practised a bit
in the event of a submarine attack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If he&rsquo;s just trying his eye,&rsquo; said the Old Man,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;ll give him all the better practice to follow us;
while, it he&rsquo;s up to mischief, it may fuss him a bit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hun had just whirled about three or four
cables&rsquo; length ahead of us, when the smoke rolling
up from the funnel and the swinging bow must
have told him that we were trying to give him a bit
more of a run for his money. Circling on a wider
turn, he came charging straight down the line of
our new course, flying at what I should say was
between two and three times the height of our
masts. We were looking at the machine at an angle
of about forty-five degrees&mdash;so that he must have
been about as far ahead of us as he was high, say,
a hundred yards&mdash;when I saw a small dark object
detach itself from under the fuselage and begin to
come directly towards us, almost as though shot
from a gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the only bomb I ever saw fall while I
was in a sufficiently detached state of mind to
mark what it looked like. &lsquo;Fall&rsquo; hardly conveys
a true picture of the way the thing seemed to approach,
for the swift machine, speeding at perhaps<!-- Page 255 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
a hundred miles an hour, must have imparted, at
the instant of releasing, a good deal of lateral
velocity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At first it was coming almost head on to the
way I was looking at it, and, greatly foreshortened,
it had so much the appearance of a round
sand-bag that it is not surprising that the skipper
took it for some kind of practice dummy. &lsquo;Probably
a dud,&rsquo; I remember him saying; &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t let
it hit you. Stand by to duck!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My next recollection is of the thing beginning
to wobble a bit, probably as the nose began to tilt
downward; but still it seemed to be coming
straight toward us rather than simply falling. I
seem to recall that the seaplane passed overhead
an appreciable space before the bomb, but I must
have heard it rather than seen it, for I never took
my eye off the speeding missile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The latter seemed at the least from fifty to a
hundred feet above my head as it hurtled over the
starboard end of the bridge, and I saw it with
startling distinctness silhouetted against a cloud
that was bright with the light of the sun it had
just obscured. It was still wobbling, but apparently
tending to steady under the combined influence
of the downward pull of the heavy head and
the backward drag of the winged tail. It appeared
to be revolving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have since thought, however, that I may have
got the latter impression from a &lsquo;spinner&rsquo; that is<!-- Page 256 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
often attached to this type of bomb to unwind,
with the resistance of the air, and expose the detonator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down it came until it whanged against some of
the standing rigging of the foremast&mdash;seeming to
deflect inboard and downward slightly as a consequence&mdash;missed
the mainmast by a few feet, and
struck squarely against the side of the deckhouse
on the poop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scene immediately after the explosion of
the bomb is photographed indelibly on my memory;
the events which followed are more of a jumble.
The detonation was a good deal less sharp than I
had expected, and so was the shock from it. The
latter was not nearly so heavy as that from many
a wave that had crashed over her bows, but, coming
from aft rather than for&rsquo;ard, the jolt had a distinctly
different feel, and by a man &rsquo;tween decks
would hardly have been mistaken for that from a
sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the flash of the explosion&mdash;a huge spurt
of hot, red flame&mdash;that was the really astonishing
thing. It seemed to embrace the whole afterpart
of the ship, and everything one of the forked
tongues of fire was projected against burst into
flame itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ramshackle deckhouse, which had been reduced
to kindling wood by the explosion, roared
like a furnace in the middle of the poop. Even the
deck itself was blazing. I had once been near an<!-- Page 257 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
incendiary bomb in a London air raid, and knew
that nothing else could have produced so sudden
and so fierce a fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I also knew that the first burst of flame
is the worst in such a case, and that most of the
fire came from the inflammable stuff in the bomb
itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I had always heard that sand was better
than water in putting out a fire of this kind, and
knowing we carried several barrels of it for scrubbing
the decks, I ordered it to be brought up and
thrown on the flames, but stood by on the bridge
myself in case the skipper, who was bawling down
the engine-room voice-pipe for more steam, needed
me for anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luckily the sand was close at hand, and they
were scattering it from buckets over the blazing
deck within a minute or two. Except for the
d&eacute;bris of the deckhouse, the fire was put out almost
as quickly as it was started, and, between
sand and water, even that was being rapidly got
under control, when suddenly the Hun, whom I
had almost forgotten in the rush of undoing his
dirty work, flashed into sight again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skipper had our ship zigzagging so short
and sharp by this time that her wake looked like
the teeth of a big, crazy saw, and this the Hun was
unable to follow closely enough to get a fore-and-aft
sight down her as he had done the first
time.<!-- Page 258 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming up astern, he kicked out a bomb just
before he was over her port quarter, but it only
shot across her diagonally, and struck the water
on her starboard side, about a hundred feet away.
It went off with, if anything, a sharper crack than
the one which had struck the poop, and the foam
geyser the explosion shot up flashed a bloody red
for the instant the water took to chill the glow of
the molten thermit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanishing even more quickly was a ragged red
star which fluttered for a moment beneath the surface
of the water itself as the flame stabs shot out
in all directions from the central core of the explosion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No water was thrown aboard us, and, near as I
was to the explosion on the bridge, the rush of air
could hardly be felt. Something that came tinkling
down after striking the side of the charthouse,
however&mdash;I picked it up when the show was over&mdash;turned
out to be a thin fragment of the steel casing
of the bomb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A similar fragment, twisted into a peculiar
shape, struck the chest of a man leaning over the
rail in the waist of the ship, inflicting a slight flesh
wound the exact shape of a ragged capital &lsquo;C.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That any kind of a living man could really be
trying to destroy a mere merchant ship in cold
blood seemed to me so monstrous, so utterly impossible,
that, until the second bomb was dropped,
I was almost ready to believe that the first had been<!-- Page 259 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
launched by accident. From then on we knew it
was a fight for life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hun took a broader swerve in bringing his
machine round for the next charge, and, ten times
quicker on his helm than we were, anticipated our
next shift of course, and came darting down on an
almost straight fore-and-aft line again. The sudden
cloud of our foreblown smoke&mdash;there was a
following wind on the &lsquo;leg&rsquo; they had put her on
at the moment&mdash;which engulfed him at the instant
his third bomb was released was the one thing in
the world that could have made him miss so easy a
&lsquo;sitter.&rsquo; The quick &lsquo;side-flip&rsquo; the sharply-banked
&rsquo;plane gave to the dropped missile threw it wide
by twice the distance the second had missed us.
Though the detonation rang sharp and clear, and
though a vicious spout of foam shot up, I could
note no effect of the thing whatever on the ship.
Whether that was his last bomb or not we could
never be quite sure. At any rate, it was the last
he tried to drop upon us, or upon any other ship
for that matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just why he returned to the attack with his
machine-gun we could only guess. It may have
been, as is probable, that he was at the end of the
small supply of bombs left from the raid he was
doubtless returning from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, however, it is just possible that the
fact that the fire was being got under control on
the poop impelled him to adopt an attack calculated<!-- Page 260 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to drive the plucky chaps who were fighting
it to cover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, flying just high enough to clear the
tops of the masts, he came swooping back, and it
was upon the men trying to put out the fire&mdash;now
confined to the wreckage&mdash;of the deckhouse&mdash;that
he seemed to concentrate his attack. Two or three
of these I saw fall under the rain of bullets, and
among them was our freight clerk, who had also
been knocked down by the explosion of the first
bomb, but who, being hardly stunned by the shock,
was soon on his feet again and leading the fire-fighters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a good deal of a character, this freight
clerk. Although well educated, he had led a free
and easy existence in various parts of the world.
For a year previous to the war he had been a cowboy,
and some queer trait in his character made
him still cling to the <i>poncho</i>, or shoulder blanket,
and baggy trousers, which are the main features of
the Argentine cow-puncher&rsquo;s rigout. It was the
Wild West rig that made me notice him when he
was knocked down by the bomb and later by the
machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was scarcely more hurt the second time than
the first, but the bullet which had grooved the outer
covering of his brain-box seemed also to have put
a new idea inside it. I saw him pull himself together
in a dazed sort of way after the seaplane
had passed, and then shake off the hand of a man<!-- Page 261 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
who tried to help him, and dash off down the ladder,
tumbling to cover, I thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been a minute or two later that I
saw him, legs wide apart to keep his balance, pumping
back at the Hun (who had swung close again
in the interim) with a rifle&mdash;a weapon which I
later learned was an old Winchester, which had
been rusting on the wall of the freight clerk&rsquo;s
cabin. He appeared to have had the worst of the
exchange, for when I looked again he was sitting,
with one leg crumpled crookedly under him,
propped up against a bitt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked still full of fight, though, and
seemed to be replenishing the magazine of the rifle
from his bandoliers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skipper sent me below to stir things up a
bit in the engine-room at this juncture, and I did
not see my cowboy friend until he had fought two
or three more unequal rounds and was squaring
away, groggy, but still unbeaten, for what proved
the final one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he ever got credit for it
or not, but the Old Man&rsquo;s plan of action at this
juncture must pretty nearly have marked a mile-post
in merchant ship defence against aerial attack.
We had been instructed in, and had practised
the zigzag before this, but that was about the limit
of our resources in this line. &lsquo;Squid&rsquo; tactics&mdash;smoke
screening&mdash;had hardly been more than
thought of for anything but destroyers. Yet the<!-- Page 262 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
wily old skipper, literally on a moment&rsquo;s notice,
brought off a stunt that could not have been improved
upon if it had been the result of a year&rsquo;s
thought and experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The instant the Hun &lsquo;stumbled&rsquo; when he
struck the cloud of smoke that was pouring ahead
of us, the skipper&rsquo;s ready mind began evolving a
plan still further to besmudge the atmosphere. Today,
with special instructions and special stuff
ready to hand, a merchant captain, if he needed it,
would simply tell the chief engineer to &lsquo;make
smoke screen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this occasion the Old Man meant the same
thing when I heard him yelling down the engine-room
voice-pipe to &lsquo;Smoke up like hell!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About all the chief could do under the circumstances
was to stoke faster and cut down the
draught. This he did to the best of his ability, but
the screen did not bear much resemblance to one of
those almost solid streams of soot a modern destroyer
can turn out by spraying oil freely and
shutting off the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such as it was, however, the Old Man made
the most of, and by steaming down the wind accomplished
the double purpose of cutting down the
draught fanning the fire on the poop and keeping a
maximum of smoke floating above the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smudge bothered the Hun, but by no means
put an end to his machine-gun practice. Except
for the freight clerk, who was still pumping back<!-- Page 263 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
at the seaplane every time it swooped over, every
one on the poop had been killed, wounded, or
driven to cover, and, with no one to fight it, the
fire was beginning to gain new headway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not good &rsquo;nuf by a mile,&rsquo; I heard the Old Man
muttering to himself as he eyed the quickly thinning
trail of smoke from the funnels. &lsquo;Must do
better&rsquo;n that or &rsquo;taint no good.&rsquo; Then I saw his
bronzed old face light up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;X&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he shouted, beckoning me to his side,
&lsquo;duck below, clean out all the stuff in the paint
lockers and chuck it in the furnaces, &rsquo;specially the
oils and turps. Jump lively!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the job I went on when I said I saw
the cowboy crumpled up against a bitt, but still
full of fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linseed oil, turpentine, and some tins of fine
lubricants&mdash;I had them all turned out of the fore-peak
and carried, rolled, dragged, or tossed down to
the stokehold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the stuff was in kegs or cans small
enough to go through a furnace door, and these
we threw in without broaching them. The Old Man
called me up twice&mdash;the first time to say that there
was no increase in smoke, and wanting to know
why I was so slow; and the second time to say that
he had just got a bullet through his shoulder, and
ordering me to come up and take over, as he was
beginning to feel groggy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an ominous crackling and sputtering<!-- Page 264 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
in the furnaces as I sprang for the ladder, and before
my foot was on the lowermost rung, one of
the doors jumped violently up on its top-swing
hinges from the kick of an exploding tin or keg of
oil. As it fell back with a clang the swish of sudden
flame smote my ears, and then a regular salvo
of muffled detonations. The last picture I had of
the boiler-room was of the stokers trying to confine
the infernos they had created by wedging shut
the doors with their scoops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole ship was a-shiver with the roaring
conflagration in her furnaces as I reached the upper
deck, and, above a tufty, white frizzle of escaping
steam, rolled a greasy jet of smoke that looked
thick enough for a man to dance a hornpipe on it
without sinking above his ankles. I found the Old
Man, with a dazed sort of look in his eyes, and his
jaw set like grim death, hanging on to the binnacle
when I gained the bridge, and all he had the
strength to say, before slithering down in a heap,
was, &lsquo;Damn good smoke! Carry on&mdash;zigzag down
wind! Think blighter has finished. Look to&mdash;fire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact that the Hun was now circling the ship
at considerable distance had evidently made the
skipper believe that he had come to the end of his
cartridges, and in this I am inclined to think the
Old Man was right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which fire, however, he referred to I was not
quite sure about, but, in my own mind, I was rather
more concerned about the one I had started with<!-- Page 265 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the ship&rsquo;s paint than the one the Hun&rsquo;s incendiary
bomb had set going. Indeed, the &lsquo;fire brigade,&rsquo;
which had taken advantage of the lull to get a hose
playing on the conflagration on the poop, was rapidly
reducing the latter to a black mass of steaming
embers. The cowboy was still snuggled up against
the bitt, which he used to rest his right elbow on
in the occasional shots he was lobbing over at the
now distantly circling enemy. When I learned
later what a crack shot the chap really was, I cannot
say that I blamed the Hun for his discretion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tempted him to make that fatal final
swoop we never knew. It may have been sheer
bravado, or he may have been trying to frighten
off the fire-fighters again. Anyhow, back he came,
allowing plenty of leeway to miss my smoke screen,
and only high enough to clear the masts by forty
or fifty feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cowboy saw him coming, and I can picture
him yet as he lay there waiting, with his cheek
against the stock of that old Winchester, and following
the nearing &rsquo;plane through its sights. With
the rare good sense of your real hunter, he didn&rsquo;t
run any risk of frightening off his quarry with any
premature shots. He just laid doggo, and held his
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Hun had been content to sit tight and
keep his head out of sight, the chances are nothing
would have happened to him; but the temptation to
have a closer look at his handiwork and to jeer at<!-- Page 266 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
his &lsquo;beaten enemy&rsquo; was too much for him. Banking
as sharply as his big &rsquo;plane would stand, he leaned
out head and shoulders above the wrecked poop,
gave a jaunty wave of the hand, and opened his
mouth to shout what was probably some sort of
Hunnish pleasantry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crack of the old Winchester reached my
ears above the roar of the seaplane&rsquo;s engine, and
the next thing I was clearly conscious of was the
machine&rsquo;s swerving&mdash;sidewise and downward&mdash;and
plunging straight into the trailing column of black
smoke. The tip of its left wing fouled the main
truck, but it still kept enough balance and headway
to carry past and clear of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It then slammed down into the water two or
three hundred feet off our starboard bow, and it
only took a point or two of alteration to bring it
under our forefoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old ship struck the mark so fair that she
cut the wreckage into two parts, and I saw fragments
of wings and fuselage boiling up on both
sides of our wake astern. I gave the order in hot
blood, but I would do the same thing again if I had
a week to think it over in, just as I would go out
of my way to kill a poisonous snake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we never knew definitely who was
responsible for polishing off the Hun. For a while
I thought it probable that the cowboy had only
wounded him, and that his swerve into the smoke
had been responsible for the dive into the sea, where<!-- Page 267 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the ship put the finishing touches on the job. But
from the day that the cowboy showed me that he
could hit tossed-up shillings with a target-rifle
four times out of five I have been inclined to believe
his assertion that he &lsquo;plunked the bloomin&rsquo;
blighter straight through the nut,&rsquo; and that I and
my smoke had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither the skipper nor the cowboy were much
hurt, and as for the ship, she probably suffered, in
the long run, more from the loss of her paint and oil
supply than from the Hun&rsquo;s bomb and the fire it
started.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>AGAINST ODDS</h3>


<p>The news from all the Fronts had been discouraging
for several days, and it only
needed that staggering announcement of the
destruction of practically a whole convoy and its
escort, in the North Sea, to cap the climax of gloom.
This is what I had read in the fog-hastened autumn
twilight, by the feeble glow of a paint-masked
street lamp, in the Stop Press column of the evening
paper a Strand newsboy had shoved into my
hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;Two very fast and heavily-armed German
raiders attacked a convoy in the North Sea, about
midway between the Shetland Islands and the Norwegian
coast, on October 17th. Two British destroyers&mdash;H.M.
ships <i>Mary Rose</i> (Lieutenant-Commander
Charles L. Fox) and <i>Strongbow</i>
(Lieutenant-Commander Edward Brooke)&mdash;which
formed the anti-submarine escort, at once engaged
the enemy vessels, and fought until sunk after a
short and unequal engagement. Their gallant
action held the German raiders sufficiently long to
enable three of the merchant vessels to effect their
escape. It is regretted, however, that five Norwegian,<!-- Page 269 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
one Danish, and three Swedish vessels&mdash;all
unarmed&mdash;were thereafter sunk by gunfire
without examination or warning of any kind and
regardless of the lives of their crew or passengers....
Anxious to make good their escape before
British forces could intercept them, no effort was
made to rescue the crews of the sunk British destroyers
or the doomed merchant ships, but British
patrol craft which arrived shortly afterward rescued
some thirty Norwegians and others of whom
details are not yet known.... The enemy raiders
succeeded in evading the British watching squadrons
on the long dark nights, both in their hurried
outward dash and homeward flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is regretted that all the eighty-eight officers
and men of H.M.S. <i>Mary Rose</i> and forty-seven
officers and men of H.M.S. <i>Strongbow</i> were lost.
All the next-of-kin have been informed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>A few days later a second Admiralty report announced
that ten survivors of the <i>Mary Rose</i> had
reached Norway in an open boat, and also gave a
few further particulars of the action in which she
had been lost. From this it appeared that she had
been many miles ahead of the main convoy when the
latter was attacked, and that, possessed of the
speed, with many knots to spare, to have avoided
an action in which the odds were a thousand to one
against her, she had yet deliberately steamed back
and thrown down the gage of battle to the heavily
armed German cruisers. Just why her captain
chose the course he did was not, and never will be,
fully explained. He went down with his ship, and<!-- Page 270 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
to none of those who survived had he disclosed what
was in his mind. It was certainly not &ldquo;war,&rdquo; the
critics said, but they also agreed that it was &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo;
enough to furnish the one ray of brightness
striking athwart the sombre gloom of the
whole disheartening tragedy. &ldquo;He held on unflinchingly,&rdquo;
concluded an all-too-brief story of the
action issued to the public through the Admiralty,
some time later, &ldquo;and he died, leaving to the annals
of his service an episode not less glorious than that
in which Sir Richard Grenville perished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the time I read these Admiralty announcements
I had the feeling that some, if not all, of
those ten survivors of the <i>Mary Rose</i> would surely
be able to offer more of an explanation of why her
captain took her into battle against such hopeless
odds than any that had yet been suggested to the
public, and in the months which followed I made
what endeavour I could to locate and have a talk
with one of them. It was not long before the ten
were scattered in as many different ships, however,
and though I had the names and official numbers
of two or three, almost a year went by before I
chanced upon the first of them. Indeed, it was but
a day or two previous to the first anniversary of the
loss of the <i>Mary Rose</i> and <i>Strongbow</i> and the destruction
of the Norwegian convoy that, in the
course of a visit to a Submarine Depot Ship at one
of the East Coast bases, I sauntered forward one
evening and fell into conversation with a sturdily<!-- Page 271 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
built, steady-eyed young seaman&mdash;some kind of
torpedo rating, evidently, by the red worsted
&ldquo;mouldie&rdquo; on his sleeve&mdash;who had just clambered
up to the forecastle from the deck of a hulking &ldquo;L&rdquo;
moored alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you like submarin-ing?&rdquo; I had asked
him, by way of getting acquainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so bad, sir,&rdquo; he replied with a smile,
&ldquo;though it&rsquo;s a bit stuffy and rather slow after destroyers.
With them there&rsquo;s something doing all
the time. I was in one of the &lsquo;M&rsquo; class before I
volunteered for submarines. P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ve heard
of her&mdash;the <i>Mary Rose</i>, sunk a year this month,
in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I cut in, as the ribbon he was
wearing caught my eye; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re one of the men
I&rsquo;ve been looking for for a number of months. Ten
to one you&rsquo;re Able Seaman Bailey, who received
the D.S.M. for his part in the action, and who is
specially mentioned in the Admiralty story&rdquo; (refreshing
my memory from a note-book) &ldquo;for having,
&lsquo;despite severe shrapnel wounds in the leg,
persisted in taking his turn at an oar&rsquo; of the Norwegian
lifeboat which picked up the <i>Mary Rose</i>
survivors, and for his &lsquo;invincible light-heartedness
throughout.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A flush spread under his &ldquo;submarine pallor&rdquo; at
that broadside, but he admitted, with an embarrassed
grin, that his name was Bailey, and that his
decoration was awarded for something or other in<!-- Page 272 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
connection with the last fight of the <i>Mary Rose</i>,
though for just what he had never quite been able
to figure out. In the hour we leaned over the forecastle
rail and watched the North Sea fog-bank roll
up the estuary with the incoming tide, this is the
account he gave me of the things which he himself
saw of what is perhaps the most gallantly tragic
of all the naval actions of the war.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t got convoying at that time down
to the system it is carried on under now,&rdquo; he began,
by way of explanation, &ldquo;and the only fighting ships
with this one were the <i>Mary Rose</i> and <i>Strongbow</i>.
The <i>Mary</i> was of the same class as the &lsquo;M ...&rsquo;
over there, very large and fast and well armed for
a destroyer, but never, of course, built for anything
like a give-and-take fight with any kind of
a cruiser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was also an armed trawler somewhere
about, but it had no chance to do anything but pick
up survivors. We were an anti-submarine escort,
nothing more, and were not intended to stand off
surface raiders. Of course provision was made
against these, too, but&mdash;well, when you consider the
size of the North Sea and the length and blackness
of the winter nights, the only wonder is that
the Huns can&rsquo;t buck up their nerve to trying for a
convoy twice a week instead of twice a year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had escorted the north-bound convoy across
to Bergen, and, on the afternoon of the 16th of<!-- Page 273 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
October, had picked up the south-bound and headed
back for one of the home ports. Escorting even a
squadron of warships which know how to keep station
is no picnic for destroyers, but with merchantmen
it is a dozen times worse. It is bad enough
even now, but a year ago, before these little packets
had had much experience, it was enough to drive a
man crazy. Between the faster ships trying to
push on, and the slower ones falling astern, and
breakdowns, and the chance of trickery, it was one
continual round of worry from the time we left
Base to our return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time was no exception to the rule, even
before the big smash. One of the Swedes&mdash;there
were Norwegian and Danish as well as Swedish
ships in the convoy, but we called them all
&lsquo;Swedes,&rsquo; probably because it was shorter and
easier to say than Scandinavian&mdash;well, one of the
Swedes shifted cargo along about dark of the 16th,
with the result that the slower ships, and this included
most of the convoy, lagged back, while several
of the faster ones kept on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether this was done by order,
or whether it just happened. Anyhow, the <i>Strongbow</i>
remained behind with the slower section, while
the <i>Mary Rose</i> pushed on as an escort for the
faster. It was the first lot&mdash;the main convoy&mdash;that
the raiders attacked first, but just what happened
I did not see, for we had drawn a long way
ahead of them in the course of the night.</p>

<h4>A LOOK-OUT ON A DESTROYER AND PART OF HIS VIEW</h4>

<p>&ldquo;When I came up to stand my watch as anti-submarine<!-- Page 274 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
lookout, on the after searchlight platform,
at four in the morning of the 17th, I remember
that it was cloudy and thick overhead, but with
very fair visibility on the water. We were steaming
along comfortably with two boilers, which gave us
a big margin of speed over everything needed to cut
our zigzags round the comparatively slow packets
we were escorting. The sea was rough but almost
dead astern, so that it made little trouble&mdash;for
the moment, that is. We had enough of it a little
later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along toward six o&rsquo;clock the visibility began
to extend as it grew lighter, but there was no sign
of the main convoy when, at exactly five-fifty, I
sighted flashes of light fluttering along the northern
horizon. Although my ears caught no sound but
the throb of the engines and the churning of the
screws, I had no doubt they were from gun-fire, and
reported them at once by voice-pipe to the Officer of
the Watch&mdash;it was Gunner T., if I remember right&mdash;on
the bridge. The captain was called, and must
have concluded the same, for he at once ordered her
put about and sounded &lsquo;Action Stations.&rsquo; That
took me to the foremost torpedo tubes, where my
station was on the seat between the tubes, with the
voice-pipe gear fitted to my ears. Most of what
followed I saw from there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some of the published accounts of the action
it was stated that the captain of the <i>Mary Rose</i><!-- Page 275 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
thought that the flashes he saw were from the gun
of a submarine shelling the convoy, so that when
he turned back it was with the expectation of meeting
a U-boat rather than powerful raiding cruisers.
I don&rsquo;t know anything definite on this score, of
course, as I only heard the captain speak once or
twice (and then to give orders) before he went
down with his ship, but I don&rsquo;t think it could possibly
have been true. There is a sort of fluttering
ripple to the flash of a salvo that you can&rsquo;t possibly
mistake for that of the discharge of a single
gun, and the flashes which we continued to see for
some time were plainly those of salvo answering
salvo. The flashes from the mingled salvoes of the
heavy guns of the Hun raiders could not have been
confused with those from the few light guns of the
<i>Strongbow</i> any more than these could have been
taken to come from the single gun of a U-boat.
Everything pointed to just what we learned had
taken place&mdash;a cruiser raid on the convoy. There
was nothing in the flashes to suggest a submarine
was firing, and I can&rsquo;t see how the captain could
have had any such impression. It was enough for
him&mdash;yes, and for all of us&mdash;to know that our consort
was in trouble, and I shall always think that
he turned back to help the <i>Strongbow</i> with the full
knowledge that he would have to face hopeless
odds. He was a proper gentleman, was Captain
Fox, and so there was nothing else that he <i>could</i>
have done; and, what&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s nothing else<!-- Page 276 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
that we men in the <i>Mary Rose</i>&mdash;or any other
British sailors, for that matter&mdash;would have had
him do. It would have been against all the traditions
of the Navy to have done anything else but
stick by a consort to the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Able Seaman Bailey smote resoundingly the hollow
palm of his left hand with the fist of his right as
he spoke those last words, and then, in a quieter
voice, took up the thread of the story again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That turn through sixteen points brought the
seas, which we had been running before all night,
right ahead, and all in a minute she was being
swept fore-and-aft by every second or third of them.
Anxious as the captain was to drive her full speed
(which would have been a pretty terrific gait, let
me tell you, for the &lsquo;Ms&rsquo; are very fast), it was no
use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plates and rivets simply wouldn&rsquo;t stand the
strain of the green water that anything like full
speed would have bored her into, and she was
finally slowed down to about twenty knots as the
best she could do without flooding the decks and
making it impossible to serve the guns and torpedo
tubes. As she was good for a lot more than this
with two boilers, I doubt very much if the third
was ever &lsquo;flashed up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first I saw of the ships which turned out to
be the enemy was some masts and funnels to the
north&rsquo;ard and about a couple of points on the starboard
bow. They were making very little smoke,<!-- Page 277 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
probably because they were oil-burners. As we
were steering on practically opposite courses, we
closed each other very quickly, and they must have
been about four miles off when the captain, evidently
becoming suspicious of their appearance,
challenged. As there was no reply, fire was opened
immediately afterward by the foremost gun, the
course at the same time being altered a point or
two to starboard, so that the other two guns would
bear. The rest of our firing was, I think, by
salvoes, or rather, it was until all but the after
gun were knocked out by the Hun&rsquo;s shells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our first shots, fired at about 7,000 yards, were
short; but as the salvoes which followed began to
fall closer to their targets, I saw the Huns alter
to a course more or less parallel to ours, but plainly
veering away so as to open out the range. This
gave me the first silhouette view I had, and I did
not need a glass to recognize them at once as German,
the three straight funnels and the &lsquo;swan&rsquo;
bows being quite unmistakable. Some of our
shots fell close, but I saw nothing I could be certain
of calling a hit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, I knew that it was not the guns the
captain was counting on, but that he was trying
to close to a range and bearing that might offer a
chance to get home with a torpedo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the Huns did not open fire before they did
I have never quite been able to figure out, unless it
was that they hoped to avoid an action and so be<!-- Page 278 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
free to pursue and sink the leading ships of the
convoy&mdash;the faster ones the <i>Mary Rose</i> had been
escorting&mdash;without interference. If that is so,
Captain Fox&rsquo;s sacrifice was not in vain, for all of
these ships escaped destruction and reached port in
safety. Even as it was, they had no stomach for
an action at any range close enough to give us any
chance to damage them either with gun-fire or torpedoes.
Their plan&mdash;proper enough in its way, I
suppose&mdash;was simply to pound us to pieces with the
shells of their powerful long-range guns, and not
to close to finish us off until all our guns and torpedo
tubes were out of action. As one good salvo
from either of them was more than enough to do the
job, there wasn&rsquo;t much hope of our getting in close
enough to do them serious harm. It was a bold
bid the captain made for it, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The course we were now on brought the seas
more abeam than ahead, so that we had been able
to shake out several more knots of speed, and this
the captain tried to use to shorten the range. We
were actually closing them at a good rate (though
I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say they were putting on
all their speed to avoid it), when the Huns began
firing their ranging shots. By this time we had
reached a position from which there was a very fair
bearing to launch a mouldie, and we were busy getting
one ready to slip while the fall of shot came
bounding nearer and nearer to us. I remember, in
a vague sort of way, that the first salvo was short by<!-- Page 279 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a long way, that the second was much nearer, and
that the third, closely bunched and exploding
loudly on striking the sea, threw up smoke-stained
spouts which fell back into each other to form a
wall of water which completely blotted out the
enemy for a second or two. Then we turned loose
the torpedo, and at almost the same instant two or
three shells from a &lsquo;straddling&rsquo; salvo hit fair and
square and just about lifted the poor little <i>Mary</i>
out of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in a second the ship seemed to disappear in
clouds of smoke and escaping steam, and it is only
natural that my recollections of the order in which
things happened after that are a good deal confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to have some memory of receiving from
the bridge the order to fire that torpedo, but if that
was so, it was the last order I did receive from
there, for the explosion of one of the shells carried
the voice-pipe away (though I did not twig it at
the time), and from then on it was mostly the sizzle
of spurting steam that came to my ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two reasons why I know that first
salvo hit us <i>after</i> the torpedo was launched, though
there could not have been more than a fraction of a
second between one and the other. The first is that
one of the shells carried away the lip of the tube
before penetrating the deck and cutting a steam-pipe.
If the mouldie had been in the tube it could
not have missed being exploded; or, if by a miracle<!-- Page 280 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
that had not happened, the tube was so much
buckled that it could not have been operated. The
second reason was that fragments from that shell,
besides wounding me in the leg, even killed or blew
overboard the rest of the crew, so that there would
have been no one to get a mouldie away even if the
tubes had been in working order. I remember distinctly
seeing the torpedo hit the water, but I have
no recollection of seeing it steady to depth and begin
to run. As that is the main thing you always
watch for, I can only account for the fact I did not
see it by supposing that first hit came before the
torpedo began to run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shock of the explosion did not knock me off
my seat, and a wound from a jagged piece of shell
casing, though it was serious enough to put me out
of commission for five months, felt only like a sharp
prick on my leg. My pal, Able Seaman French,
collapsed in a limp heap under the tubes, and
though I saw no blood or signs of a wound, and
though I never saw a man killed before, I knew he
was done for. I don&rsquo;t know to this day where he
was hit. The man whose station was at the breech-blocks
I never saw again, living or dead, so I think
he must have caught the unbroken force of the explosion
and been blown back right over the starboard
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This shell, in bursting the main steam-pipe,
probably had the most to do with bringing us to
stop, though another (I think of the same salvo)<!-- Page 281 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
exploded in Number Three boiler-room and started
a big fire, probably from the oil. The clouds of
black smoke and steam rising &rsquo;midships made it impossible
to see what was going on there. I saw
some of the crew of the &rsquo;midships gun struggling
in the water, and took it that they must have been
blown there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That gun was out of action, anyway, and, because
I did not hear it firing, I assumed that the
foremost one had also gone wrong. The after gun
was firing for all it was worth, though, and continued
to do so right up to the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That one salvo pretty well finished the <i>Mary
Rose</i> as a fighting ship, and as soon as the Huns
saw the shape we were in, they began to close, firing
as they came. But even then they were careful to
choose a direction of approach on which the after
gun could not be brought to bear. With the foremost
tubes out of action, and no crew to serve them
in any case, there was nothing for me to do but sit
tight and wait for orders. So I just chucked my
head-gear, which was no longer of use with the
voice-pipes gone, and settled back in my seat to
watch the show and wait till I was wanted. There
was really nothing to stay there for, but it was my
&lsquo;Action Station,&rsquo; and I knew it was the place I
would be looked for if I was needed. On the score
of cover, one place is as good an another&mdash;in a destroyer,
anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the fact that the after gun<!-- Page 282 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
was the only one still in action that brought the
captain back from the bridge. There was really
nothing to keep him on the bridge, anyway. He
seemed to be making a sort of general round, trying
to see what shape things were in and bucking
everybody up. He was as cool and cheery as if it
was an ordinary target practice, with no Hun
cruisers closing in to blow us out of the water. I
saw him clapping some of the after gun&rsquo;s crew on
the back, and when he came along to the foremost
tubes, not noticing probably that I was the only one
left there, he sung out: &lsquo;Stick it, lads; we&rsquo;re not
done yet.&rsquo; Those were his exact words. I remember
grinning to myself at being called &lsquo;lads.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we <i>were</i> done, even then. The Huns were
inside of a mile by now, and firing for the water-line,
evidently trying to put us down just as
quickly as they could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All their misses were &lsquo;shorts.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t remember
a single &lsquo;over.&rsquo; They were still taking no unnecessary
chances. As soon as they were close
enough to see that our torpedo tubes were probably
jammed to port, they altered course and crossed
our bows and steamed past the other side, where
there was no chance of our slipping over a mouldie
at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were already settling rapidly, with a heavy
list to port, and as soon as the captain saw she was
finished, he gave the order: &lsquo;Abandon ship. Every
man for himself!&rsquo; Those were the last words I<!-- Page 283 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
heard him speak. He went below just after that to
see about ditching the secret books, I believe, and
when I saw him again it was just before she sank,
and he was pacing the quarterdeck and talking
quietly with the First Lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As our only boat had been smashed to kindling-wood,
there was nothing to it but to take to the
Carley Floats, and the first thing I did after hearing
the order to abandon ship was to see to cutting
one of these loose. On account of our oilskins and
life-preservers, neither myself nor any of the three
or four lads from the after gun&rsquo;s crew that ran to
the float with me could get at our clasp-knives.
Luckily, one of the Ward Room stewards came to
the rescue with three silver-plated butter-knives
from the pantry, and with these we finally managed
to worry our way through the lashings. Then we
pitched the little webbed &lsquo;dough-nut&rsquo; (as the
Carley Floats are called) over the settling stern
and jumped after it. Four or five minutes later,
after heeling slowly to port through fifty or sixty
degrees, she gave a sudden lurch and went down,
turning completely over as she sank, so that her
bottom showed for a few seconds. The captain,
who could have followed us just as well as not,
seemed to make no effort to save himself, and must
have gone down with her. I can&rsquo;t help believing
that was the way he wanted it to happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had clambered into the float as fast as we
could, and I think some one must have said something<!-- Page 284 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
about the danger of being caught over an
exploding depth-charge, for we were paddling (all
of these floats have short-handled paddles lashed to
their webbing) away from the ship as fast as we
could when she went down. Someone remembered
that one of the &lsquo;ash cans&rsquo; had been set on the
&lsquo;ready&rsquo; when we went to &lsquo;Action Stations,&rsquo; and
no one recalled seeing it thrown back to &lsquo;safe&rsquo; before
we went overboard. It was an anxious
moment, waiting after she ducked under the sea,
for we had not been able to paddle more than a
hundred yards, and the detonation of a depth-charge
had been known to paralyse men swimming
in the water at twice that distance. Luckily, this
particular charge must have been set for a considerable
depth, and it is also possible that the hull
of the ship absorbed or deflected some of its force.
At any rate, the shock of it, when it came, though it
knocked us violently against each other and left
a tingling sensation on the skin of all the submerged
part of one&rsquo;s body, did not do anyone
serious injury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we came to count noses, there turned out
to be eight of us on the float&mdash;two sub-lieutenants,
the captain&rsquo;s steward, myself, and the remnants of
the crew of the after gun. A few minutes later we
sighted a couple of men who looked to be struggling
in the water, but turned out to be supporting themselves
on a fragment of &lsquo;dough-nut,&rsquo; which had
broken loose when the ship sank. That, strange
to say, was the only bit of wreckage that came to<!-- Page 285 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the surface. We took these men aboard, and the
ten of us weighted the overloaded float so that is
submerged till the water reached our armpits. We
were a good deal better off than it would seem,
though, for the most of us were heavily dressed, and
the animal heat of a man keeps him warm for a long
time under oilskins and wool. The only ones that
suffered much were a couple of lads who didn&rsquo;t have
any more sense than to ditch most of their togs
before they went over the side. They said it was
so as not to be hampered in swimming&mdash;as if they
expected to do the &lsquo;Australian crawl&rsquo; to Norway
or the Shetlands! These two <i>did</i> begin to get
a bit down-hearted and &lsquo;shivery&rsquo; when the cold
struck into the marrow of their bones, and it was
with the idea of bucking them up a peg or two that
we started singing. No, I don&rsquo;t just remember all
that we did warble, except, I&rsquo;m glad to say, that
&lsquo;Tipperary&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t on the programme, and that
this did include two or three hymns. You&rsquo;re quite
right. There&rsquo;s nothing very warming to a chilled
man in hymns, and I&rsquo;m not trying to account for
why we sang them. The fact remains that we <i>did</i>,
just the same, and that we all, including the chaps
in their underclothes, lived to sing again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a bit of a disappointment when an

luck. She came bowling along under sail about ten
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, on sighting the black
silk handkerchief we hoisted at the end of a paddle-blade,
eased off her sheet and stood over to pick us
up. As there were only six men in her, we were not
badly off for room, while the store of biscuit and
potted stuff&mdash;to say nothing of smokes&mdash;they had
managed to throw aboard before their ship sunk
was more than enough for the two days that it took
us to row and sail to Bergen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ROUNDING UP FRITZ</h3>


<p>There are only two or three conditions under
which a destroyer can hope to surprise a U-boat
on the surface, and none of these is approximated
at the end of a clear North Sea summer
afternoon with the stalking craft trying to
approach from a direction which silhouettes its
leanly purposeful profile against the golden glimmer
of the sunset clouds. This particular capsule
of Kultur, rising with typical Hunnish
effrontery for his evening constitutional in an
especially well-watched area while it was yet broad
daylight, still had the advantage of visibility sufficiently
on his side to make the thing a good deal
less risky than it looked. The skipper, doubtless
coolly puffing his pipe as he lounged over the rail
of the bridge and filled his lungs with fresh air,
must have seen the masts and funnels of the speeding
<i>Flash</i> for a good half hour before the latter&rsquo;s
look-out sang out that he had picked up the conning-tower
of what looked to be a U-boat two
points off the starboard bow; so that all that was
needed was the change of course which followed
that report to give Fritz fair warning that it was<!-- Page 288 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
time to hide his head for a while. Indeed, he must
have been going down even as he was sighted, for
it was the matter of but a very few seconds more
before the <i>Flash</i> found herself tearing at upwards
of a thousand yards a minute into an empty sea.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, it is probable we gave
that Fritz a fairly good run for his money in
showering the spot where he had disappeared with
what depth-charges we could spare, and then, like
a fox-terrier after a rat, standing by and &ldquo;watching
the hole.&rdquo; Unluckily, we had used a good part
of our stock of &ldquo;cans&rdquo; the day before, when a
rather more promising opportunity for attack had
offered itself, while as for &ldquo;watching the hole,&rdquo;
this particular patch of the North Sea chanced to
be one in which that way of playing the game was
fraught with special difficulties because it was sufficiently
shallow for a submarine to lie doggo on
the bottom without danger of having its shell
crushed in by the pressure of the water. This
defeated the uncannily sure way of tracking the
U-boat down by &ldquo;listening,&rdquo; and demanded another
form of special treatment, which we were not,
however, at the moment prepared to administer.</p>

<p>Slim as the chance was, the captain was reluctant
to leave while any hope remained, and it was
only a signal ordering the <i>Flash</i> to join in some
other work that had turned up (a destroyer is
subject to as many kinds of summons as a country
doctor) that took him off in the end. Mooring a<!-- Page 289 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
buoy to mark the spot for &ldquo;future reference,&rdquo; the
captain saw her headed off on the course she was
to hold till daybreak, and then took me down to the
Chart House for a bowl of ship&rsquo;s cocoa before turning
in. It was some question I asked about the
practice of placing buoys over possible U-boat
graveyards, to make it easy to resume investigations
if desired, that started him on a train of anti-submarine
reminiscence that led back to one of the
smartest achievements of its kind in the whole
course of the sea war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are times,&rdquo; he said, leaning back on the
narrow couch that served as his &ldquo;sea-bed,&rdquo; and
bracing with outstretched legs against the twisting
roll, &ldquo;that a Fritz will do things that would lead a
superficial observer to think that he had a sense of
humour. Of course, we know that he hasn&rsquo;t anything
of the kind (any more than he has honour,
sportsmanship, decency, or any other of the attributes
of a normal civilised human being). But the
illusion is there just the same, especially when he
tries on such little stunts as the one he incubated
a couple of months ago in connection with a buoy
I dropped to mark the spot where there was a
chance that my depth-charges might have sent him
to the bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just about such an &lsquo;indeterminate&rsquo; sort
of a strafe as the one we&rsquo;ve just had&mdash;no chance for
gun-fire, not much to go by for planting depth-charges,
and, in the end, nothing definite to indicate<!-- Page 290 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
that any good has been done. So, in case it was
decided that my report was of a nature to justify
further looking into, I left a securely moored buoy
to furnish a guide as to where to begin, quite as
we have to-night. Well, it chanced that the S.N.O.
at Base reckoned that there was just enough of a
hope to warrant following up. Indeed, you may
be sure there isn&rsquo;t much that isn&rsquo;t followed up
these days, now that we&rsquo;ve got our whole comprehensive
plan into operation and adequate craft to
support it with. So he sent out quite a little fleet
of us&mdash;craft fitted to do all the various little odds
and ends of things that help to make sure one way
or the other what has really happened to Fritz.
Luckily, <i>Flash</i> was able to return with them. If
she had not&mdash;if someone who had not seen the lay
of things after the strafe the night before had not
been along to &lsquo;draw comparisons&rsquo;&mdash;Fritz&rsquo;s little
joke might have turned out a good deal more
pointed than it did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We picked up the buoy without any difficulty,
as the day was fine and the sea fairly smooth&mdash;just
the weather one wanted for that kind of work.
While we were still a mile or more distant, the lookout
reported a broad patch of oil spreading out from
the buoy for several hundred yards on all sides.
This became visible from the bridge presently, and
at almost the same time my glass showed fragments
of what appeared to be wreckage floating both in
and beyond the &lsquo;sleek&rsquo; of oil. Now if there had<!-- Page 291 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
been any evidence whatever of either oil or wreckage
the night before I should not have failed to
hail this morning&rsquo;s exhibit with a glad whoop and
nose right in to investigate. But as, when I gave
up the fight, I had dropped that buoy into an extremely
clean patch of water&mdash;even after the stirring
my depth-charges had given it&mdash;the plenitude
of flotsam did not fail to arouse a certain amount
of suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ordering the sloops and trawlers to stand-off-and-on
at a safe distance, I went with the <i>Flash</i> to
have a look at a number of fragments that were
floating a couple of cables&rsquo; lengths away from the
buoy. A piece of box&mdash;evidently a preserved fruit
or condensed milk case&mdash;with German letters stencilled
across one end was undoubtedly of enemy
origin, as was also a biscuit tin with patches of its
gaudy paper still adhering to it. I did not like the
careful way the cover of the latter had been put on,
however, and, besides, tins and cases are quite the
sort of thing any submarine throws over just as
fast as it is through with them. It was some real
wreckage I was looking for, and this it presently
appeared that I had found when the bow wave
threw aside a deeply floating fragment of what&mdash;even
before we picked it up&mdash;I recognised as newly
split teak. Closer inspection revealed the fact that
it was newly split all right, but also the fact that
an axe or hatchet had had a good deal to do with
the splitting. What had probably been a part of a<!-- Page 292 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
bunk or locker had apparently been prised off with
a bar and then chopped up into jagged strips. Attempts
to obliterate the marks of bar and axe by
pounding them against some rough metal surface
had been too hasty and crude to effect their
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That settles it,&rsquo; I said to myself. &lsquo;Fritz is trying
to play a little joke on us by making us think
he is lying blown-up on the bottom, while, in fact,
he is probably lying off somewhere waiting to slip
a slug into one of the most likely looking of the
salvage ships. Now that we&rsquo;ve twigged the game,
however, we&rsquo;ll have to do what we can to defeat
it.&rsquo; As senior officer, I ordered the three destroyers
present to start screening in widening circles, while&mdash;on
the off-chance that there really was a wreck
on the bottom&mdash;a pair of trawlers were sent to drag
about the bottom under the messy patch with an
&lsquo;explosive sweep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My diagnosis was quite correct as far as it
went, but it did not go quite far enough; still&mdash;by
the special intervention of the sweet little cherubim
who sits up aloft to keep watch o&rsquo;er the life of poor
Jack&mdash;my plan of operation was quite as sound as
if I had all the facts of the case spread out before
me. Had the U-boat really been lurking round
waiting for a pot at some of the ships trying to save
his supposed remains&mdash;something that we never
gathered any definite evidence on&mdash;our screening
tactics would probably have prevented his success;<!-- Page 293 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
while the trawlers, with their sweep, furnished the
best antidote for the little surprise party that he
already <i>had</i> prepared for us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scarcely had the trawlers entered the oily area
than the jar of a heavy under-sea explosion jolted
against the bottom of the <i>Flash</i>, which, a thousand
yards distant, was just beginning to work up to
full speed. Almost immediately three or four other
explosions followed, coming so close together as to
make one rippling detonation of tremendous violence.
An instant later I saw several columns of
grimy foam shoot skyward, two or three of them so
close together that they seemed to &lsquo;boil&rsquo; into each
other as they spilled and spread in falling. Although
neither of the trawlers appeared to be
immediately over any of the explosions, both of
them received terrific shocks. One of them I distinctly
saw rear up till it seemed almost to be
balanced on its rudder-post as a round hump of
green water drove under it, while the scuppers of
the other spurted white as they cleared the flood
that a spreading foam geyser had thrown upon the
deck. It seemed impossible that either of them
could survive such shocks as I knew they must have
received, and I fully expected to see nothing better
than two foundering wrecks emerge from the
smother which hovered above the scene of the explosions.
Imagine my surprise, then, when two junk-like
profiles (they were both of the marvellously
sea-worthy &lsquo;Iceland trawler&rsquo; type) came bobbing<!-- Page 294 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
serenely into sight again, and I noted with my glass
that neither appeared to have suffered serious damage.
On the score of lives, a tom-cat has nothing
the best of a trawler. If it had been otherwise our
whole fleet of them&mdash;and they, with the drifters,
form the main strands of the finer meshes of our
anti-U-boat net&mdash;would have been wiped out many
times over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the instant the jar of the first explosion
made itself felt, the thought flashed through my
mind that there actually was a U-boat lying on the
bottom, and that the explosive charge on the sweep
had been detonated against its hull. The
&lsquo;bunched&rsquo; explosions immediately following also
lent themselves to this theory, and it was not till
the distinct columns of blown water began rising
in the air that I surmised the real cause of them&mdash;mines,
probably laid so close together that the
explosion of the first had set off the others. This
fact we were shortly able to establish beyond a
doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What had happened, as nearly as we could
reconstruct it, was this: The U-boat had been a
mine-layer, probably interrupted on its way to lay
its eggs off one of our main fleet bases. The
chances are that it had been sufficiently injured
by my depth-charges to make it more of a risk than
its skipper cared to take to proceed farther from his
base; quite likely, indeed, he had to put back at
once. Then the chance of preparing a little surprise<!-- Page 295 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
party for the ship responsible for his trouble
must have occurred to him, and the result was that
a snug little nest of mines was laid all the way
around the marking buoy. Having more mines
than he needed to barrage the buoy, he had scuttled
several of those remaining after the first job was
completed, and these had been the ones set off by
the explosive charge on the trawlers&rsquo; sweep. The
spreading of wreckage as bait around the trap was
probably an afterthought, for it was so hurriedly
done that it really defeated the end it was intended
to accomplish. I am inclined to think, in fact, that,
if the mines had laid round the buoy, with no
spread of oil or wreckage left to decoy us into them,
they might have had a victim or two to their credit.
They were laid shallow enough to have bumped
both sloops and destroyers, and the exploding of
a mine against the bows of one or the other of
these may well have been the first warning we had
of Fritz&rsquo;s little joke. As it was, that part of the
show was so crudely done that it gave away that
something was wrong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have always thought of that as &lsquo;Fritz&rsquo;s
little joke,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued the captain, bracing himself
at a new angle to meet a rollicking cork-screw
action that was working into the ship&rsquo;s wallowings.
&ldquo;It was just the sort of a plant I would like to
have left for Fritz, if our r&ocirc;les had been reversed,
and for a while I felt rather more kindly toward
all Fritzes on account of having knocked up<!-- Page 296 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
against it. That feeling persisted until three or
four months later, when the fortunes of war&mdash;in
the shape of a luckily-planted depth-charge&mdash;paved
the way for an opportunity for me to tell the story
to a certain Hun <i>Unterseeboot</i> officer during the
hour or two he was my guest on the way to base.
He spoke English fairly, and understood it well;
so that I was able to run through the yarn just
about as I have told it to you. He gave vent to his
approval in guttural &lsquo;Ya&rsquo;s&rsquo; and grunts of satisfaction
until I ended by asking him if he didn&rsquo;t
think it was a jolly clever little joke. And what do
you think he said to that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Choke,&rsquo; he boomed explosively; &lsquo;choke, vy,
mein frent, dot vos not ein choke ad all. He vos
dryin to zink your destroy&rsquo;r. Dot ist no choke.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain stretched himself with a whimsical
smile. &ldquo;How unpleasant it would be to be shipmates
with a chap like that who couldn&rsquo;t see the
funny side of being blown up,&rdquo; he observed
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as unpleasant,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;as it is pleasant
to be shipmates with a man who <i>could</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After thus rising to the occasion, I was emboldened
to ask the captain to tell me a little more
about that &ldquo;luckily-planted depth-charge&rdquo; he had
referred to so casually, and its train of consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the result,&rdquo; he said with a smile, handing
me several small kodak prints from his pocketbook.<!-- Page 297 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
&ldquo;What little yarn there is to tell I&rsquo;ll rattle
off for you with pleasure after I&rsquo;ve been up to the
bridge for a bit of a &lsquo;look-see.&rsquo; Seems as if she is
banging into it harder than she ought for this
course and speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light went out as the automatic switch cut
off the current with the opening of the door, and
when it flashed on again, as the door was
slammed shut, I found myself alone, with the prints
lying in the middle of the chart of the North Sea.
Two of these showed a thin sliver of a submarine
that might have been of almost any type. A third,
however, showed an unmistakable U-boat, heeling
slightly, and with a whaler alongside, evidently in
the act of taking off some of the men crowded upon
the narrow forward deck. And in the background
of this print was lying a long slender four-funneled
destroyer that I recognised at once as either the
<i>Flash</i> or another of the same class. On the back
of this print was written &ldquo;Quarter view of U.C.&mdash;at
14.10. <i>Flash&rsquo;s</i> whaler transferring prisoners;
<i>Splash&rsquo;s</i> whaler&rsquo;s crew clearing decks of wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fourth print, similar to the third but much
covered with arrows and writing, appeared to be a
kind of key to the latter. An angling sort of bar,
which appeared as a black line above the bows in
the photograph, was labelled &ldquo;Nut Cutter,&rdquo; and
several other characteristic U-boat devices were
similarly indicated. These all established points of
great technical value, doubtless, but a keener<!-- Page 298 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
human interest attached to the legends penciled at
the feather ends of arrows pointing to two figures
on the deck of the submarine, just abaft the conning-tower.
Opposite the one that appeared to be
leaning over a light rail, with one arm extended as
though he was in the act of giving a command,
was written, &ldquo;Deceased captain of submarine.&rdquo;
Against the other, a sprawling inert heap huddled
up against the conning-tower, appeared, &ldquo;Man
with both legs shot off (alive).&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a lot of history crowded into that
scrawled-over print, and I was still gazing at it
with awed fascination when the opening door
winked off the light, and then closed again to reveal
the captain, dripping with the blown brine of the
wave that the <i>Flash</i> had put her nose into at the
moment he was coming down the ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather more of a sea than I expected to-night,&rdquo;
he said as he pulled his duffel-coat over his head
and sat down to kick off his sea-boots; &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve
slowed her down a few knots and we&rsquo;ll jog along
easy till daylight.&rdquo; Then, as he recognised the
photo in my hand, &ldquo;Rather a grim story that little
kodak tells, isn&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;ll find just about all of
the yarn you were asking for down there in black
and white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I replied hastily, recognising from
long experience the forerunning signs of a modest
man trying to side-step going into details respecting
some episode in which he happens to have<!-- Page 299 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
played a leading part. &ldquo;Not quite. It chances
that I&rsquo;ve heard something of the bagging of U.C.&mdash;from
Admiral &mdash;&mdash; not long after it occurred, and
he said it was one of the cleverest bits of work of
the kind that anyone has pulled off. I didn&rsquo;t connect
you and the <i>Flash</i> with it, though. But now
that you&rsquo;re caught with the goods, the chance to
hear several of the details the Admiral had failed
to learn is too good to miss. How did you manage
to slip up on her in the first place, and did you
wing her skipper at the outset, and&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently figuring it would be best not to let me
pile up too big a lead of questions for him to answer,
the captain sat down resignedly and took up
the thread of the story at somewhere near the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did we manage to slip up on her?&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;Well, principally, I should say, because
she was &lsquo;preoccupied.&rsquo; I told you last night
that I used to get away for a bit of tiger shooting
while I was on Eastern stations, and you mentioned
that you&rsquo;d had a go at it yourself now and then.
So we both have probably picked up a smattering
of the ways of tigers. Now I&rsquo;ve always maintained
that the fact that I had given a bit of study to the
ways of man-eaters was a big help to me in understanding
the ways of Huns. A hungry tiger, on
the prowl for something to devour, is about the
hardest brute in the world to stalk successfully;
while, on the other hand, one that has made its<!-- Page 300 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
kill and is sating its bloody lust upon it is just
about the easiest. It&rsquo;s just the same with a U-boat.
The one best chance we have of surprising one on
the surface is while it is in the act of sinking a
merchantman by bombs or shell-fire, or just after
the victim has been torpedoed and the pirate is
standing-by to fire on the boats and pick up any
officers it may think worth while to take prisoner.
That was what was responsible for the luck that
befell me in the instance in question. The U.C.&mdash;a
day or two previously to the one on which she
was slated to meet her finish, had sunk the British
merchantman <i>Hilda Bronson</i>, and carried off as
prisoners the captain and mate. These men, after
we rescued them, were able to give us some account
of how their hosts spent the morning of the day on
which they encountered the <i>Flash</i>. Their general
practice, of course, was to submerge in the daytime
and run on the surface, charging batteries, during
the night. Emboldened by two or three recent successes
in sinking small merchantmen by gun-fire
and bombs, they appeared to have become very contemptuous
of our anti-submarine measures, and
declared that they were just as safe on the surface
in the daytime as at night. Bearing out the probability
that these words were by no means spoken
in jest, is the fact that they did not dive at daybreak,
but continued to cruise on the surface on
the look out for unarmed ships which could be
safely sunk without risking the loss of a torpedo or<!-- Page 301 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
damage to themselves by gun-fire. This class of
ships&mdash;fortunately, there are few of them left save
under neutral flags&mdash;was the U-boat&rsquo;s favourite
prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock their search was rewarded.
The two British sailors heard a number of shots,
and presently understood the U-boat skipper to declare
that he had just put down a small Norwegian
steamer with shell-fire. As they were still full up
with the stores looted from the <i>Hilda Bronson</i>, no
attempt was made to take off anything from the
sinking Norwegian. All morning the pirate continued
cruising on the surface, diving only once.
Great attention was given to surroundings, stops
being made about once an hour to heave the lead.
In this they displayed good sense beyond a doubt,
for it is worth a lot to a submarine to know whether
it can dive straight on to the bottom without encountering
a pressure strong enough to crush it in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About noon another helpless victim&mdash;this time
a British merchant steamer&mdash;was sighted, and the
imprisoned sailors counted nine shots before tremendous
consternation and confusion spread
through the submarine as fire was opened on her
by some ship coming up from the same direction as
the merchantman bore, and she dived with all possible
dispatch. This was where the <i>Flash</i> began to
take a hand in the game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the fact that this particular Fritz ought
easily to have sighted us at twice the distance at<!-- Page 302 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
which we opened with our foremost 12-pounder
bears out exactly what I said about the traits the
Hun and the tiger have in common. They are both
&lsquo;foul-feeders,&rsquo; and begin to see so red, once the
blood-lust of prospective satiation is upon them,
that they are half blinded to everything else. If
this fellow hadn&rsquo;t been so absorbed in doing that
little steamer to death he need never have let us
get within a range that would have permitted more
than a swift shot or two at his disappearing conning-tower.
It was his sheer &lsquo;blood-drunkenness&rsquo;
that gave us our chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a day of very low visibility&mdash;not over a
mile and a half, or two miles at the outside&mdash;and I
was out on a bit of an escort stunt of small importance.
The first intimation I had that anything
out of the usual run was afoot came in the form of
sharp gun-fire on my starboard beam. It sounded
fairly close at hand, and though no ship was visible,
there was just a hint of luminosity in the mist-curtain
to indicate the direction of the gun-flashes.
The helm was immediately put hard-a-port and the
telegraphs at Full Speed, and off went the <i>Flash</i> to
investigate. Scarcely had I turned than a wireless
signal was brought to me on the bridge repeating
the calls of assistance of a steamer that was
being shelled by an enemy submarine. That little
&lsquo;flying start&rsquo; of mine, which involved leaving the
ship I was escorting and jumping out without
waiting for orders, gave me the minute or so to<!-- Page 303 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the good which probably made all the difference
between success and failure. But that is quite
characteristic of destroyer work; more than in any
other class of ship, you are called on to decide for
yourself, to jump out on your own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first thing I saw was the dim blur of a
small merchantman taking shape in the mist, and
as the image sharpened, the splash of falling projectiles
became visible. She was throwing out a
cloud of smoke and zigzagging in a panicky sort of
way in an endeavour to avoid the shells which were
exploding nearer and nearer at every shot. As she
caught sight of the <i>Flash</i> she altered course and
headed straight up for us, and, busy as my mind
was at the moment, I could not help thinking how
like her action was to that of an Aberdeen pup I
used to own when he saw me coming to extricate
him from his daily scrap with a neighbour&rsquo;s fox
terrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just at the moment that the merchantman
turned up to get under our wing that the
sharpening gun-flashes began revealing the conning-tower
of a submarine. We had gone to Action
Stations at once, of course, and I am practically
certain that the opening shot of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sl&rsquo; gun was
the first warning Fritz had that his little kultur
course was about to be interrupted. Under the
circumstances, the fact that he effected his disappearing
act in from thirty to forty seconds indicates
very smart handling; too smart, indeed, to<!-- Page 304 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
give us a fair chance to get in a hit with a shell,
although the gunners made a very keen bid for it.
Their turn came a few moments later, however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once Fritz had passed from sight there was
only one thing to do, the thing we <i>tried</i> to do to-night&mdash;depth-charge
him. And there really was
no difference in what we did on the one occasion
and what we did on the other&mdash;nothing, I mean to
say, except the result. Estimating his course from
the point of submergence, I steered directly over
where I judged he would be and let go one of those
very useful type &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; charges. Well,&rdquo;&mdash;the captain
smiled in a deprecatory sort of way&mdash;&ldquo;the
depth-charge isn&rsquo;t exactly what you&rsquo;d call a
&lsquo;weapon of precision,&rsquo; and so it follows that when
you hit what you are after with one it must be
largely a matter of luck. Judgment? Oh, yes, a
certain amount of it, but I&rsquo;d rather have luck than
judgment any day. At any rate, this was my lucky
day. Within fifteen seconds from the moment I
felt the jolt of the detonating charge Fritz&rsquo;s conning-tower
was breaking surface on my starboard
beam. Helm had been put hard-a-port as the charge
was dropped, so that all the starboard guns were
bearing on the conning-tower the instant it bobbed
up. This was right on the outer rim of the &lsquo;boil&rsquo;
of the explosion&mdash;just where it would be expected&mdash;and,
of course, it presented an easy target. To say
it was riddled would be putting it mildly. One
shot alone from the foremost six-pounder would<!-- Page 305 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
have made it out of the question for it to dive again,
even had other complications which had already
set in left it in shape to face submergence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A second or two more, and the whole length of
our bag was showing, riding fairly level fore-and-aft,
but with a slight list to starboard. We had now
turned, and from our position on the submarine&rsquo;s
port quarter could plainly see the crew come bobbing
out of the hatch on to the deck. Each of
them had his hands lifted in the approved &lsquo;Kamerad&rsquo;
fashion, and took good care to keep them
there as long as they noticed any active movement
around the business ends of our guns. As a matter
of fact, as there had been no colours flying to
strike, those lifted hands were the only tangible
tokens of surrender we received. As we had her at
our mercy, however, they looked conclusive enough
for me, and I sent a boat away as quickly as it
could be lowered and manned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not until this boat returned that I
learned of the two British merchant marine
officers who had been aboard her through it all.
The Huns had crowded them out in their stampede
for the hatches, so that they had been the very last
to reach the deck. Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;, who was in charge
of the whaler, compensated as fully as he could for
this by taking them off first. The experiences they
had been through had been just about as terrible
as men could ever be called upon to face; and yet,
when they clambered aboard <i>Flash</i>, they were smiling,<!-- Page 306 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
clear of head and eye, and altogether quite unshaken.
You&rsquo;ve certainly got to take off your hat
to these merchant marine chaps; they&rsquo;ve fought
half the battle for the Navy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story they had to tell of what they had
seen and heard during their enforced cruise in the
U-boat was an interesting one, but on the final act&mdash;largely
because the curtain had been rung down
so quickly&mdash;there was little they could add to what
had passed before my own eye. The shock from the
depth-charge&mdash;which appears to have detonated
just about right to have the maximum effect&mdash;was
terrific. The whole submarine seemed to have been
forced sideways through the water by the jolt, and
just as all the lights went out one of them said that
he saw the starboard side of the compartment he
was in&mdash;it was what would correspond to the Ward
Room, I believe, a space more or less reserved for
the officers&mdash;bending inward before the pressure.
Instantly the spurt of water was heard flooding in
both fore and aft, and that alone was sufficient to
make it imperative for her to rise at once. As it
was only a minute or two since she submerged,
everyone was at station for bringing her to the
surface again, so that not a second was lost in
spite of the inevitable confusion following the sudden
dive and the explosion of the depth-charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There had been a mad lot of rushes for the
ladders and hatches, but the skipper, it appears, got
up first, through the conning-tower to the bridge,<!-- Page 307 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
as the official leader of the &lsquo;Kamerad Parade.&rsquo; He
was just in time to connect with the first shell from
our foremost six-pounder, and that, or one of the
succeeding projectiles which were fired before it
was evident they were trying to surrender, accounted
for several others in the van of the opening
rush. The officer in charge of the whaler reported
seeing several dead bodies lying on the deck and
floating in the water, among these being that of
the captain, which was taken back to Base and
given a naval funeral. There were also two or
three wounded. Of unwounded there were fifteen
men and two officers, out of something like twenty-four
in the original crew. One of the officers
claimed to be a relation of Prince Henry of Prussia,
but why he didn&rsquo;t claim the Kaiser himself, who is
full brother to Prince Henry, I could never quite
make out. As this was the same officer I told you
of as not being able to see a joke, I didn&rsquo;t think
it worth while to try to follow the ramifications of
his family tree any farther. The engineer asserted
that he had already been in eight warships which
had been destroyed, these including a battleship
and two or three cruisers and motor launches. I
did the best I could to comfort him by telling him
that, in case the <i>Flash</i> wasn&rsquo;t put down by a U-boat
in the three or four hours which would elapse before
we made Base, he need have no further worries
on the sinking score for some time to come. Just
the same,&rdquo; he concluded, with a shake of the head,<!-- Page 308 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
&ldquo;I was glad to see that chap safely over the side.
No sailor likes to be shipmates with a &lsquo;Jonah,&rsquo;
especially in times like these.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time we had finished transferring the
prisoners the <i>Splash</i> had joined us, and her captain,
being my senior, took charge of the rest of the
show. On my reporting that I had several severely
wounded Huns aboard, he ordered me to return to
Base with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s about all there is to the yarn,&rdquo;
said the captain, rising and starting to pull on his
sea-togs preparatory to going up for another
&ldquo;look-see&rdquo; before turning in. Then something
flashed to his mind as an afterthought, and he relaxed
for a moment, red of face and breathless, from
a struggle with a refractory boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one thing I shall always be glad
about in connection with that little affair,&rdquo; he said
thoughtfully, a really serious look in his eyes for
almost the first time since I had seen him directing
the dropping of the depth-charges early in the evening;
&ldquo;and that is that I didn&rsquo;t know in advance
that those two British merchant marine officers
were imprisoned in the U.C. &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; with the Huns
when we came driving down to drop a &lsquo;can&rsquo; on her.
My duty would have been quite clear, of course,
and, as you doubtless know, some of our chaps have
faced harder alternatives than that without flinching
or deviating an iota from the one thing that it
was up to them to do; but, just the same, I&rsquo;m not<!-- Page 309 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
half certain that the instinct, or whatever you
want to call it, which seemed to jog my elbow at
the psychological moment that charge had to be let
go to do its best work&mdash;I&rsquo;m not at all sure that instinct
would have served me so well had I known
that success might have to be purchased by sending
two of my own countrymen&mdash;yes, more than that,
two sailors like myself&mdash;to eternity with the
pirates who held them as hostages. Yes, it was a
mercy that I didn&rsquo;t have that on my mind at the
moment when I needed all the wits and nerve I had
to get that &lsquo;can&rsquo; off in the right place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Visibly embarrassed at having allowed his feelings
to betray him&mdash;a British naval officer&mdash;into a
display of something almost akin to emotion, the
captain stamped noisily into the stuck sea-boot and
disappeared, behind a slammed door, into the night.</p>
